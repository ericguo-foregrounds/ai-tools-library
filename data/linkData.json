After 30 days, all your data will be deleted. To resume service, please update the credit card as soon as possible. If you have any difficulties or questions, please reach out to our customer support team for assistance.\n\nInvoices for your subscription charges are automatically sent by our credit card processor, Stripe, to the email associated with your account.\n\nYes ‚Äì we have a 10% discount for annual plans.\n\nWe hold our customers responsible for managing their accounts, credit limits, and overages. Refunds are only applicable to the current subscription charge on your account, not for overage charges from the prior month. Please note that we incur significant cost to index your content and respond to chatbot queries.\n\nIf you feel that a refund is justified, please respond directly to¬†¬†to begin the discussion about a possible refund. We ask that you cancel your account first to process a full refund to speed up the potential refund process.  \n  \nWe will respond to your request within 1-2 business days. Your refund request will be timestamped and honored when you send your email. We appreciate your patience and understanding.\n\nYou can select a¬†[pricing plan](/)¬†to meet your business need based on the **amount of data** you want to utilize, and number of CustomGPT.ai chatbot **queries** you want to offer per month.\n\nA good rule of thumb: 10M words is about 50MB of data (your actual words might vary!)\n\nIt is recommended to sign up for a higher plan and then adjust later because indexing will stop immediately when you hit your plan limits.\n\nA project is basically a single chatbot. The chatbot is a self-contained ChatGPT chatbot trained on your data. Our standard $99 plan lets you have 10 active chatbots and higher pricing plans support more.\n\nSo, for example: You could create one chatbot with your website content. And create a separate chatbot with your support documents for internal use.\n\nYou can delete unused chatbots to stay within your plan limits. This let's you create ‚Äúthrowaway‚Äù chatbots for quick use.\n\nA ‚Äúpage‚Äù is basically a single resource like a ‚Äúwebpage‚Äù, ‚Äúdocument‚Äù, ‚Äúfile‚Äù, ‚Äúvideo‚Äù or ‚Äúaudio‚Äù. Our standard $99 plan lets you create chatbots with up to 5000 ‚Äúpages‚Äù. This could mean 5000 webpages. Or 5000 uploaded documents. Or a mix of webpages, documents or videos.\n\nSo, for example: You could create a chatbot with your website content which has 3250 webpages. Then add 1000 documents from your support team. Then add 750 Youtube videos. This would make it 3250 + 1000 + 750 = 5000 ‚Äúpages‚Äù\n\nImportant: When your chatbot hits the plan's ‚Äúpages‚Äù limit, the system will stop crawling and processing your ‚Äúpages‚Äù.¬† And you will see the ‚ÄúLIMITED‚Äù icon in your crawl status page. It is recommended to sign up for the correct plan depending on the number of ‚Äúpages‚Äù your business needs.\n\nOne common misconception: **If your PDF file has 100 pages, it counts as 1 ‚Äúpage‚Äù in our system, not 100.**\n\nThe plan limits are across the entire account. For example: If you sign up for the $99/month plan, you can store 60 million words across 10 ‚Äúprojects‚Äù. This allows you to share your plan limits across the 10 projects.\n\nIt is recommended to sign up for the correct plan based upon the total data you plan on indexing.\n\nNo, if you exceed your plans query limit, you will need to upgrade or wait until the billing cycle resets.\n\nTo change your email, name or password in CustomGPT.ai, please log in to your account and navigate to the ‚ÄúAccount Settings‚Äù section. There you will find options to update your email, name and password. If you encounter any issues, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to our support team for assistance at \n\nFrom the Login page, select the ‚ÄúForgot password?‚Äù option to reset your password.",

Also, the customer support has been excellent.\n\n![Image 5](blob:)\n\n###### Matt Estes\n\nChief Revenue Officer, Uscreen\n\nIt‚Äôs time to switch to Outplay when..\n-------------------------------------\n\n![Image 6]()\n\n#### You outgrow spreadsheets and manual outreach\n\nA spreadsheet and time are all you need to get started with outreach. This works until it doesn‚Äôt. You fall behind your outreach targets, replies and follow-ups slip through the cracks, and you miss quota as a result.\n\nWith Outplay, you can automate outreach and follow ups for an entire list of contacts across email, social, chat, and phone. Plus, you‚Äôll have the deep insights you need to optimize your sequences. More outreach. No more missed replies and follow ups. Blow past your quota.\n\n![Image 7: Share Icon]()\n\n#### You need more than just email outreach\n\nEmail automation helps you automate email outreach (obviously) ‚Äî but what about Twitter, text, phone, and chat outreach? Either you‚Äôre not reaching prospects there, or you aren‚Äôt reaching them often enough.\n\nWith Outplay, you can snap together personalized automated email and social outreach campaigns. Then, when the time is right, reach out via the dashboard dialer or magic chat.\n\n![Image 8: Block Icon]()\n\n#### You can‚Äôt burn through leads and risk blacklisting\n\nCombining automated outreach and lead scraping in one tool sounds great, right? But this can lead to mass outreach to low-quality lists shared by other customers. Translation: burning through leads, low deliverability, even being blacklisted.\n\nWith Outplay, you bring a scrubbed list of leads and we give you everything you need to reach out automatically across channels in a way that doesn‚Äôt throw up red flags.\n\n![Image 9]()\n\n#### You don‚Äôt want to feel like an afterthought\n\nThe big two hide their pricing (you know what this means), build for enterprise teams, and charge for the support you need to make use of their complex product.\n\nOutplay‚Äôs pricing is published and a fraction of what the big two charge, it‚Äôs built with growing SMBs like you in mind, hands-on support is your sat no charge, and you‚Äôll start prospecting within days of signing up.\n\n### Trusted by sales team of all sizes\n\nThe only sales tool you need\n----------------------------\n\n### Get the widest library of integrations\n\nOutplay has bi-directional integrations with a wide range of CRMs, meeting schedulers, monitoring tools, inboxes and more help your stack work as one.\n\n![Image 10](blob:)\n\n![Image 11](blob:)\n\n### Engage across channels\n\nEngage with prospects across Email, Phone, SMS, Whatsapp, Video, and Website chat and automatically move them across sequence with action-based triggers.\n\n![Image 12](blob:)\n\n![Image 13](blob:)\n\n### Capture insights to make smart decisions\n\nUse reports to discover your best sequences, salespeople, and teams to duplicate what‚Äôs working and fix what isn‚Äôt.

Every time you search with Seamless.AI, our sales software scours the public web in¬†real-time to pull the freshest, most up-to-date contact data for your sales list-building efforts.\n\n### How much does Seamless.AI cost?\n\nSeamless.AI is free for up to 50 credits. After that, we offer many pricing options to best fit your team's needs. Click here to [see full features and pricing]().\n\n### Is Seamless.AI legit?\n\nYes, Seamless.AI is legit. We are the real deal. But don‚Äôt take our word for it.\n\nLinkedIn ranked us at #7 on their 2022 list of the [Top 50 Startups](). G2 named us one of their¬†[Top 100 Highest Satisfaction Software Products for 2022](). And we have amazing [testimonials]() of clients and [President‚Äôs Club winners]() we‚Äôve helped generate millions of dollars in sales deals.\n\n### What does Seamless.AI do?\n\nSeamless.AI is a sales intelligence software that helps salespeople find the best leads.\n\nHere are a few use cases:\n\n*   You Need Sales Leads: You have a great product or service but need sales leads. Seamless.AI will help you identify your ideal prospect, figure out your total addressable market, and pull accurate contact information for those specific prospects.\n*   You Have an Incomplete Sales List: You have a sales leads list, but it is missing information. Use our sales software to enrich your list and fill in missing contact information for your prospects.\n*   You Have Companies You Want to Contact: You know which companies you want to contact but don‚Äôt have the contact information of the decision-makers. Use our sales software to find up-to-date contact information and build a quality sales leads list. Then email or call the prospect, qualify them, and close the deal!\n\n### How does Seamless.AI compare to ZoomInfo?\n\nSeamless.AI is different from ZoomInfo because we are a real-time search engine, not a database. When you look up a prospect‚Äôs contact information on our platform, we search in real time to pull up-to-date and accurate information. By contrast, companies like ZoomInfo store information in databases that can quickly get stale and outdated. Our real-time searches, powered by artificial intelligence, are a defining feature that makes us different from anything else on the market.\n\n### Is Seamless.AI safe as an add-on?\n\nYes, Seamless.AI is a safe add-on to your browser. You can also use our secure Chrome Extension as an add-on and turn your Chrome browser into the ultimate prospecting tool.\n\n \n\nReady to Try Seamless.AI?\n-------------------------\n\n[Get a Demo]()\n\n![Image 101: Seamless.AI company logo]()\n\nThe World‚Äôs Best Sales Leads¬Æ\n\nConnect with Us\n\n[+1 (614) 665-0450](tel:+16146650450)\n\n[Seamless.AI LinkedIn Profile]( Facebook Profile]( Instagram Profile]( X /Twitter Profile]( YouTube Profile]( Tiktoc Profile]()\n\nProducts\n\n[Platform Overview]( Extension]( Intelligence]( Enrichment]( Intent Data]( Changes]()\n\nCustomers\n\n[Testimonials]( Studies]( for President's Club]( Your Story]( Base]( Support]( Status](/)\n\nCompany\n\n[About Us]( Program]( Us]()\n\nBooks\n\n[The Power Of Going All In]( Ultimate Guide To Breaking Into Tech Sales]( It Takes]( Secrets]( Figure Social Selling]()\n\nSocial\n\n[Linkedin]( / Twitter]()\n\nPolicies\n\n[Terms of Use]( Policy]( Policy]( Policy]( Not Sell or Share My Information]()\n\n[Terms of Use]( Policy]( Policy]( Policy]( Not Sell or Share My Information]()\n\n¬© 2024 Seamless.AI",

You can start with a list of leads, either prospected through Clay or from your own CRM, and follow the steps below.\n\n### Step 1: Basic Data Enrichment & Cleaning\n\nClay combines 75+ data enrichment tools into one marketplace, resulting in superior data coverage and quality‚Äîon anything from contact information to company firmographics. Our customers have tripled data coverage vs. providers like Zoominfo while cutting costs by a magnitude of ten or twenty.\n\n### Step 2: AI Data Enrichment\n\nWe enable you to use AI to do research that previously required manual SDR work, including reading and analyzing webpages, PDFs, and Google searches for specific information.\n\n### Step 3: Automated Outreach\n\nOnce you‚Äôve nailed your data enrichment, you can use AI to craft relevant, compelling messaging based on that data. Everything syncs back to your CRM, allowing your team to go from campaign idea to execution in seconds.\n\n### What kinds of companies use Clay?\n\nWe serve GTM teams of all sizes, ranging from large enterprise companies to SMBs, startups, solo founders, outbound agencies, and more. We have thousands of users and hundreds of paying customers, including Ramp, Pave, Verkada, and more.\n\n### Who on my team should use Clay?\n\nHere are a few typically successful team setups we‚Äôve seen with Clay.\n\nAt enterprise companies:\n\n*   **GTM leaders** decide the criteria for lead enrichment, segmentation, and outreach\n*   A **GTM operations** team member implements the above criteria into Clay. (Clay is the team‚Äôs ‚Äúenrichment layer,‚Äù which syncs to the CRM to keep data live and accurate).\n*   **SDRs** do not interface directly with Clay. Instead, they benefit from already-curated leads, enriched data, personalizations in their CRMs.\n    *   For example, one client‚Äôs SDRs simply click a button in Salesforce to fetch enriched data from Clay, including relevant a company summary, relevant contacts, and a draft message.\n\nAt startups, a growth lead often implements Clay and runs all of the company‚Äôs outreach single-handedly. Once the company reaches some level of volume, these startups hire a sales team member to help with live conversations.\n\nAt outbound agencies, one founder often sets up and runs Clay campaigns on behalf of many clients.\n\n### What tools does Clay replace for me?\n\nClay can replace your prospecting, data enrichment, and AI message drafting tools. We don‚Äôt replace email sending tools or CRMs (we integrate with them!)\n\nMany people run successful campaigns using just Clay, an email sending tool, and a CRM.\n\nYou can continue to use any tools you have subscriptions to in Clay.\n\n### What common use cases can I accomplish in Clay?\n\n[Build lists]() from CSVs or 10+ prospecting sources including free access to companies, people, and open jobs data.\n\n[Enrich data]() with 75+ enrichment tools for superior data quality and coverage as compared to relying on just one tool.\n\nUse AI to scrape websites, [do unstructured research]() that previously required SDRs, and [draft messages]().\n\nTeams commonly also use Clay to automate outbound lead generation campaigns, CRM enrichment, inbound lead scoring and outreach, and more.\n\nStart molding your dream campaigns today\n----------------------------------------\n\nStart your 14-day Pro trial today.

Any time I get a new pitch or a new meeting invite with a prospective client, I plan to check Ferret first.‚Äù\n\n![Image 37: Paul Grinberg headshot]()\n\nPaul Grinberg\n\nChairman, Axos Bank\n\n‚ÄúWe provide asset management and financial planning services to high-net-worth clients. This entails managing portfolios across a broad spectrum of asset classes, including investments in private companies. For the first time, Ferret makes it possible for our firm to continuously monitor every risk-relevant founder, executive, advisor, and board member. It helps us fulfill our fiduciary duty to our clients and that‚Äôs why we use it.‚Äù\n\n![Image 38: Martin Adams headshot]()\n\nMartin Adams\n\nCo-Founder,  \nSkalata Ventures\n\n\"I work in law enforcement and run a non-profit for wounded veterans and service-members. It‚Äôs my duty to protect our members and the reputation of my organizations. Ferret gives me intelligence on-demand when I‚Äôm deciding who to trust or who to do business with. For a non-profit, it‚Äôs a tool to separate legitimate potential partners from crooks who could cause us harm. It‚Äôs not a criminal background check, business and reputation intelligence delivered at the right time.\"\n\n![Image 39: Mikhail Venikov headshot]()\n\nMikhail Venikov\n\nChairman, Ranger Road  \nFormer MMA¬†Fighter\n\n![Image 40: Paul Grinberg headshot]()\n\nPaul Grinberg\n\nChairman, Axos Bank\n\n![Image 41]()\n\nDamien Lanyon\n\nFounder &¬† CEO,  \nLanyon Advisory Services\n\n![Image 42: Mikhail Venikov headshot]()\n\nMikhail Venikov\n\nChairman, Ranger Road  \nFormer MMA¬† Fighter\n\n### Latest Blog Posts\n\n[#### See All Posts ![Image 43]()\n\n[]()\n\nIntelligence\n\nBRI\n\nPRI\n\nPersonal Security\n\nPersonal Privacy\n\n[#### What is Due Diligence? | Ferret]()[##### Read More ![Image 44]()\n\n[]()\n\nFerret\n\nInvestors\n\nBRI\n\nIntelligence\n\nUse Cases\n\n[#### Before You Walk into that Meeting, Check Ferret First]()[##### Read More ![Image 45]()\n\n[]()\n\nFerret\n\nInvestors\n\nCulture\n\nIntelligence\n\n[#### How Ferret‚Äôs Unique Trust System Uses AI to Keep You Safe]()[##### Read More ![Image 46]()\n\n##### See All Posts\n\n![Image 47]()\n\n### Before You  \nRegret It, Get Ferret\n\n[![Image 48]()\n\n[Sign Up for Free]()\n\n### Join Our Team  \nWe're Hiring\n\n[VIEW OPEN POSITIONS]()\n\n![Image 49]()\n\n###### Join our Newsletter\n\n![Image 50]()\n\nThank you!

It should be easy.It feels great to find that unique high-quality stock image that makes your project stand out. Or that makes your advertisement wow viewers. Or that makes your designs breathtaking. Or that makes your client work differentiated from competitors. Or that makes readers look up to your next editorial. Or that doesn't limit your use. Or that doesn't make you worry about licensing issues. Or that doesn't make you worry about licensing issues.But things changed.You started finding it challenging to get quality images that haven't been overused, and differentiating your work while adhering to tight deadlines is a constant struggle, the licensing terms are like black boxes; the licensing terms are either not clear or they are limiting your usage, the ideal images that fit your needs and wants have been overused by your competitors diluting your project originality.Stock visuals became like fast fashion \"Fast visuals\".And Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay, Getty just let it happen.Now getting compelling images is an irritating pain, rather than a relief. Something stresses you, something that frustrates you, not making you feel pleasant. Rather than enjoying the process, you deal with it.And yet, stock visuals are still needed. Thanks to creativity, creatives, lovers of beauty, wow makers, revelers of designs, businesses, and creative professionals who create something magical and exceptional daily. It makes it easy for businesses to make their brand stand out, for creative professionals to create captivating projects, and for millions of people to earn a living.So good news, the magic is still there. It's just de-prioritized. Buried under the mess of ads and neglect. Some from people, some from machines, a lot from algorithms.Stock visuals deserve a dust-off. A renovation. Prioritizing quality over quantity. Problem-solving over ads seeking. Relief over frustration.With Wallpea, we‚Äôve done just that. It‚Äôs a redo, a rethink, a simplified, potent reintroduction of stock visuals.

Similarly, if you need a paraphrasing tool, SpinBot will get the job done for you for that purpose as well.\n\nHaving Tons of Engaging Content is Vitally Important\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nHaving a continuous flow of fresh, human-readable text is the best way for your website or blog to gain search engine exposure. Content is King, as they say! It is an extremely important as of search engine optimization. In this manner, SpinBot can be a vital tool for anyone who wants to market their website or product online as quickly and efficiently as possible. With all the unique, quality textual content you could ever want, you will quickly gain legitimate web visibility, both in terms of human readership and search engine exposure.\n\n![Image 6]()\n\n![Image 7]()\n\n### Include capitalized words if you choose\n\nThere is the option to rewrite capitalized words (assumed to be proper nouns or titles) as well as leave any number of words unchanged, depending on whatever you enter into the ‚Äúignore‚Äù field, separated by commas.\n\n![Image 8]()\n\n### Get new visitors & keep them happy\n\nAs an Internet marketer, you need something better than artificial link building and pages of useless, jumbled nonsense to get long-lasting traffic referrals from major search engines (i.e. Google).Google in particular pays special attention to your visitors‚Äô behavior.

Either way, SpinBot will serve you as a powerful, free tool to ensure that your content stays fresh, interesting and growing over time.\n\nSpinBot is simply the best free article spinner on the internet today.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt beats any other article rewriting tool on the web, in terms of intelligence, human readability, speed and convenience, hands down, every time.\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td>‚úÖ Enhances</td><td>Grammar, clarity, and readability</td></tr><tr><td>üñã Modes</td><td>Basic and advanced</td></tr><tr><td>üí´ Quickly spins</td><td>Essays, paragraphs, and assignments</td></tr><tr><td>üí™üèº Ideal for</td><td>Students, Researchers, and Bloggers</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n![Image 10]()\n\n### Content Creating Awesomeness\n\nUsing SpinBot you can instantly spin, rewrite or paraphrase a chunk of textual content up to 10,000 characters in length (or about 1000 words). 10,000 characters is typically longer than an average website page or freely-distributed article. With a single click you can turn your old blog post or website article into a completely new one, thereby doubling the payoff you get in return for the time and energy you have already invested into creating quality website content. SpinBot is lightning fast as well as free, so there is potentially no limit to the amount of free web content that you can create using this tool.\n\n### Say \"Goodbye\" to Clunky Article-Rewriters\n\nThere are some \"free\" article spinners out there that require you to enter your text with properly formatted \"spintax\" in order to create the end result. But now you need a totally separate tool to create this machine formatted text, so there are extra, time consuming steps involved. However SpinBot does all thinking for you, from taking in the context of every phrase to creating additional textual content that is as readable and meaningful as the text you originally entered.\n\nOther article spinners also require that you enter your own custom synonyms manually or individually approve lists of potential synonyms as they are presented to you. This is another way of expecting you to do most of thinking, as opposed to expecting the software to be smart enough to instantly make judgment calls for you. Thus, one of SpinBot's main goals is to make the article spinning process as quick and painless as possible.\n\n![Image 11]()\n\n![Image 12]()\n\n### One Click and Done. No Strings.\n\nSpinBot is a one-click article rewriter that requires no sign-up or registration if you want to use the free version. This software does not spit out \"spintax\" formatted results, nor does it require you to enter spintax to create newly rewritten content. All you need to do is enter human readable text and you will get human readable text out.\n\nHear what our clients say\n-------------------------\n\nDon't just take our word for it, hear what people have to say about us.\n\n1.  ![Image 13]()\n    \n    It‚Äôs an incredible resource for crafting fresh, unique content, no matter how you approach it. My search for top-notch gaming triggers led me to SpinBot, highly praised in online reviews. I recommend SpinBot for genuine, game-enhancing products. SpinBot reigns as the premier article spinner online. It outshines every other rewriting tool in terms of intelligence, human-friendly content, speed, and ease.

In other words, it‚Äôs pretty speedy!\n\nHow can I summarize videos into text?\n\nThere are two ways to summarize the transcriptions from your videos‚Äîusing our ‚Äòrecord a video‚Äô feature or uploading a video.

In either case, Notta will upload and transcribe the speech in your video in a few minutes. Click the video on your dashboard and you can view the footage as well as the full transcript.\n    \n5.

No worries, simply create your own framework from scratch! Or choose one of the many amazing examples created and shared by the community from inside the app.\n\nSpeed of development is remarkable, the founder seems to be rolling out new features constantly. The only thing I dislike is how much of a sycophant I've become. Seriously, just join in and get ready to be blown away. They are in the process of preparing full training materials which can't be easy when the product is being developed so quickly. For now you will need to learn from the community - there is a huge library of hints and tips on Notion, collated and created by the group admins. There is also a load of YouTube videos from the founder demonstrating new features, which you will find links to in the Facebook group. The community in the Facebook group is exceptional and there is always someone posting who can help out.\n\nClosersCopy will spoon feed you AI generated content from pre-made templates as good as all the others, but the real value comes from creating your own frameworks and joining them together to create custom workflows with their proprietary AI. Not sure how they did it, but in my experience it's vastly superior to OpenAI.\n\nI wish I'd found this before all the other GPT-3 tools I've bought in the last year - I would have saved a fortune!\n\nI have to tell you ... this CC is phenomenal !! I bought Jarvis only 2 days ago but it's NOTHING compared to this. I'm honestly astounded at how \"intelligent\" it is. My blog post is way better than anything I could have produced. With Jarvis I had to spend a lot of time re-writing, but with CC I didn't need to rewrite anything. I also have Spin Rewriter but again I have to spend so much time making so many changes because the finished article made no sense. I'll be cancelling Jarvis, for sure!! And I won't be using Spin Rewriter again. I'm very slow with CC naturally, but when I've read all the help documents and done a tour, I can see I'll be using it every day. You're a lifesaver. üòÄ CONGRATULATIONS on a beautiful, intelligent, and amazing product üòÄ Sincerely, Catherine Rzecki ‚ù§\n\nWhat I liked, is that not only you can use their GPT-3 AI, but you can train their AI to use your very own custom frameworks.\n\nIn my opinion, ClosersCopy is pretty much the combination of the perfect tool box for a copywriter, and I was really impressed with the results. As a beginner copywriter, I ended up writing 8 ads in few hours, and I was actually proud of having done that myself even if I had to use an AI to help.\n\nPS - They currently have a lifetime deal and have a 15% discount that you can use with the coupon: LIFETIME15\n\nWithout doubt, both THE best Ai tool and ltd I have ever purchased!\n\nNico is an insane level developer and ClosersCopy has continued to improve and grow at a phenomenal pace.\n\nThe recent update, allowing users to train their own frameworks was a game changer, elevating ClosersCopy far beyond Nico, into a powerful community driven product!\n\nAlmost daily, you can jump into the Facebook group, and alongside an attentive and knowledgeable team, to find a new framework, feature or valuable insight.\n\nIf you are able to, BUY THIS NOW! The price, in line with it's value, will only continue to grow.\n\nCongrats Nico!\n\nTo the Moon üöÄ\n\nBesides, I was familiarizing myself with Jarvis and, frankly, I didn't think that CC could beat Jarvis. But I decided to test CC on the use of long form, which is really what I am interested in. I tried to write a philosophy essay, and just provided the first paragraph. The outcome was AMAZING. It was like having a dialogue with a colleague. The result is just a fine piece of philosophy. And I must add: it was all in Spanish. Immediately, I paid for the lifetime deal, which, by the way, it is far cheaper than the rest of the writing assistants. \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe tool is huge useful to me in my daily life. ClosersCopy saves me thousands of hours for idea generation, outline creation, long-form content writing and so on. The frameworks is awesome. I can build my custom frameworks within a minute. The new features and improvement are being added regularly. The support is also brilliant. The founder Nico is a kind man to support and listen to the community people. I love Closerscopy.\n\nIt's not just for direct marketers. Anyone can use these proven tools for stronger results in any area of their life. I'm also a student and it helps me with writer's block!\n\nThis is a truly remarkable product and I highly recommend it! I can't wait to see what else Nico brews into the tool!\n\nI'm crossing my fingers and hope to get an integrated Fact Checker by Christmas. ;)\n\nIt's the best of the bunch. The output from this tool is of such a high quality that it feels almost like magic.\n\nThe best part of this AI tool is it's custom frameworks, with custom framework you can generate the output the way you will like in your tone and your way of writing.\n\nI also appreciate that it has a very active and helpful community. All in all, an outstanding product, and I highly recommend it.\n\nClosersCopy has some tricks up it's sleeve when compared to its direct competitor Jarvis: such as Frameworks and a proprietary AI along with GTP-3.\n\nI find myself using CloserCopy every day and I look forward to seeing it evolve in the coming years. The community on Facebook, along with Nico, seems to be the secret sauce for such an amazing product.\n\nI can't recommend ClosersCopy any more highly! :)\n\nTo the moon üöÄ\n\nai, Writesonic, and more), I stumbled upon Closerscopy. And I'm glad I did. It's helped me double my writing output myself, and I'm training my writing team to use it as well. Took less than a month for me to recover my investment in the LTD - absolutely worth it. And Nico is one of the best developers I've seen - always prompt to respond and he's actively developing it further. Can't wait for CC to go all the way to the moon!\n\nIt's surprisingly simple to use, so it works great for beginners or people who are more advanced. The templates are fantastic and include templates for blogs, sales pages, email campaigns, landing pages etc. It's helped me come up with creative and unique ideas on the fly, and It does an excellent job at creating high quality content at a fraction of the cost of hiring a professional copywriter.\n\nThe community that has grown around this AI tool is one of the more involved and helpful groups I belong too and I am in a bunch of them. Of all the AI tools I have collected, there are two that I use every day and CC is one of them. Keep up the great work CC and I will keep cranking out the content - thanks in part to your wizardry. - Steve D.\n\nEverything was resolved and he was super polite. For easy to get started templates I definitely recommend ClosersCopy üôÇ Thanks again for your help, Nico!\n\n..all the new updates that had been done to make copywriting is as easy as possible and I'm don't have any regret for my investment in ClosersCopy cause I think this software is a Goldmine for who want to make a living in copywriting also this ClosersCopy is the copywriting essentials for the future and beyond your imagination. I love ClosersCopy, it is an AWESOME Tools for my business ............ PERIOD!\n\nThe community is amazing and the way Nico listens to feedback and constantly evolves the tool is like nothing I've experienced. 10/10.\n\nThe fact that it was designed to help people write better copy before the AI integration happened, gives this tool a structure that none of the others have. I'm really looking forward to seeing where this tool goes, it's an awesome addition to my software arsenal.\n\nNico is also a great guy with the right vision.\n\nIt's a completely different breed compared to those that are lately escaping the GPT-3 zoo. And that's a good thing.\n\nAnd another great thing - the author didn't incentivize his customers to leave a review here - and let's admit it, that's a rarity on PH lately, lol.\n\nIt's extremely flexible, and you can adapt it to your own style using custom workflows & frameworks. Most importantly, Nico is continually tweaking, improving and adding amazing upgrades that have drastically increased the overall value of the product. Highly Recommended!\n\nTo my surprise, ClosersCopy‚Äôs AI model (GPT-3 DaVinci) understood the words and phrases I used as commands ‚Äî without even using shortcode. With just the EXPAND tool, I came up with a lot of UNREVEALED USE CASES it can offer.\n\nIt's simple and effective. I can use it to create my articles and blog posts, and it's the best investment I've made. It's easy to use, it saves me hours every week, and I love how it makes my articles look great. I highly recommend this product.\n\nongrats on the launch of losersopy at ProductHunt! I've been using this AI writing software since August 2020! A fantastic AI writer for sales copy, ads, articles, blogs, emails, you name it! Try it and be blown away! Take losersopy to the moon, Nico! Good luck and wishing you all the best!\n\n‚Äôm super excited, bought my subscription at like 1 in the morning!! ü§£ü§£ Now 'm poking around and so far LOVE the U, and the insights! Not only am seeing good templates but feel like 'm walking through a Masterclass and learning better Copywriting skills!!! Great Job Nico!\n\nClosersCopy has evaluated from a framed-writing assistant into an AI-enhanced writing powerhouse. It takes a while to get used to the workflow, but I love the constantly developing framework library. All the best @nico\\_engler !\n\nNico has released surprising and regular updates. With the new frameworks, you can actually create contents for your niche. Thanks Nico for your IM toy.\n\nThis is increasingly rare in today's world and a great indicator of the type of business that Nico is building long-term. If you write sales copy, then this is a no-brainer.\n\nUpdates have been regular and having this in my Digital Warrior Toolset, has been very helpful, for marketing purposes but also For building anything online that requires good copy.\n\nI am using this for the last 3 months and new changes never cease to amaze me. Thanks Nico for the hard work and listening to us - small people! It may take a little time to get used to but totally worth it.\n\nIt has an easy UI and navigation and I don't need any training while using it cause it has such a simple interface for all my copywriting needs.\n\nI have been very impressed by ClosersCopy and ?nico\n\nYou'll always get a lot of ideas from the community and the tutorials.\n\nBeen onboard since just about day one and Nico is the real deal. Pace of development melts your face.\n\nThis tool helps to write very unique copy by following copywriting protocols. NO PLAGIARSM. My best buy this year!\n\nIn my opinion they have the best editor with tons of features. Yesteday they introduced a new version of the editor... oh boy.\n\nNico and users add very useful frameworks and functions all the time.\n\n00\\. Oh well. Thank you once again for your help.\n\nNico had done a great job in building some cool features with custom frameworks.\n\neen on board for few months and this awesome tool is developing at lightning speed!! Kudos to Nico for sending this to the moon!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüöÄ üöÄ üöÄ\n\nDefinitely recommend it.\n\nTo the moon üöÄ\n\nHuge UI improvement and the AI is coming along nicely ‚≠ê\n\nhumbs up ! You won't regret the purchase !\n\nI'm not sure if it's Nico or Megatron (ClosersCopy AI) that replied to my refund email, but I'm sold. I hold my refund and watch it grows until now. I'm not a copywriter or business owner that needs copywriting for ads or blog posts. I'm just a developer that needs some content for my staging/development websites so my review might not be suitable for you.\n\nWhat I like the most about CC is how flexible it is (no GPT-3 restrictions). Do you know that CC have 3 different AI engine? SalesAI to write sales pages, ads and promotional emails, BlogAI to write articles, blogs and press-releases, and lastly StoryAI to write stories. You can also create your own framework to generate endless amount of copies!\n\nHere's a snippet taken from one click of community framework inside CC (thanks Anshul Jain!) using SalesAI engine. I didn't modify much to make it relevant:\n\nClosersCopy is NOT a ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù scheme that can write your blog posts or ads with just one click. It's not going to solve your problems with copywriting overnight, nor is it a magic pill that will make you a world-class copywriter. But what it WILL do is provide you with an endless amount of relevant examples, and allow you to create high-converting sales copy much faster and easier. I think it‚Äôll be very valuable to most copywriters and business owners.\n\nYou can try for a month and refund if you're not satisfied with it.\n\nLet's go to the moon üöÄ\n\nOr we might have missed it due to CC development speed ü§™\n\nWhen I came across ClosersCopy, almost a year ago, the likes of other \"AI content creators\" such as Rytr, Shortly ai, Jarvis a.k.a. \"Conversion AI\" were making waves on Facebook. ClosersCopy wasn't making its wave over the water, if you will, it was a tsunami making its way in undetected.\n\nClosersCopy wasn't quite up to par then, but as the months went by, Nico, the developer and owner of ClosersCopy, started bringing in updates that have been impressive, to say the least.\n\nThe frameworks that have been created and shared by other CC users, within our Facebook community, are priceless.\n\nThe constant positive and friendly engagement from ClosersCopy's Facebook followers has given my wife and I a place to call home in the Facebook community.\n\nEspecially when it comes to framework creation ideas or learning how to use and combine ClosersCopy's newest features for great content. ClosersCopy has opened up a \"Pandora's Box\" for creative and brainstorming ideas on how to utilize ClosersCopy's AI engine to produce engaging, relevant and meaningful content.\n\nWe can't say enough about ClosersCopy, Nico and Aura Gatton ClosersCopy Facebook admin, they're the best.\n\nThanks Nico! For dedicating your time to make ClosersCopy a part of our business and make writing fun.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nWe're all going to the moon now! üòÅüöÄ ¬∞‚óã\n\nReally the tool is a very helpful tool to write content for my website. Good thing is they got plenty of custom frameworks that are available for free, which makes it the best AI tool in the market.I have tried other tools but none of them compare to ClosersCopy's features and capabilities.Time to talk about LEGEND - Yes its none other than a wonderful SOUL called NICO the founder of CC.Ya Nico is a nice person who always makes sure that we get what we were dreaming for. I swear Nico is the only person whom i have seen to really cares about his customers ( family ) and also tries his best to make sure that we get what we want from him as soon as possible. Love u Nico...Thanks for giving us this at affordable price with unlimited plan.God bless you with Health & Happiness\n\nFirst time I using this tool, they provide a lot of templates in sales letter, email, web copy and ads. The most often tools that I used is sales letter tools that save my time, I just use copy wizard or drag and drop copy template to my editor and then edit a few text to match with my related product. They also provide insight analysis tools like emotion, sentence, keyword and spam that give me insight to make my copy better. Now, they deliver new great feature by adding AI framework that help me to automate my writing copy and I love it. The most often AI feature that I used are Expand and Rephrase. It will create new copy based on your highlight text inside editor. Thank you for delivering great copywriting tools.\n\nSince I have a space to write then I will write with my own brain, not with AI this time, this is to say Thank you for the dedication, devotion and the hard work behind this beautiful platform. I've been following lots of comments and feedback on facebook, youtube and the entire web about Closer Copy, with no doubt I grabbed the highest tier, but I couldn't get the time to use it, I've been logging in and out without understanding how to use it, but today we are on holiday and I had a great time to use it intensively and I was totally impressed and fall in love with it.Well... Thank you very much CC Heros and I wish you all the best\n\nIt has helped me create content faster than ever before. Oh, and that blinking cursor of death, it has seldom shown his face since I met this wonderful app. I'm more impressed with Nico, the creator. His dedication and hard work have made ClosersCopy significantly improve over time. An excellent software coupled with a great founder is the perfect recipe for success. This is definitely one of the best AI writing tools out there, if not the best.\n\nWith the power of AI as your assistant it is now easier than ever to generate useful engaging content. Thanks to Closers Copy I now have an unlimited long form AI empowered text editer. Thanks Nico Engler and team this app is definitely one worth using.\n\nGlad you're the owner of ClosersCopy. May you have abundant blessings to come like what you are giving to us members. May you have an unlimited wealths and happiness in life. Again, thank you so much.\n\nAt first I didn't believe in it, I took me probably 10 ads to convert. But what a conversion it has been, hats off, I'm using your tool more than Grammarly now.\n\nAnd the AI that they use is just out of this world...I honestly don't think there is a better deal on the internet for copy software...Do yourself a favor, and get this RIGHT NOW!\n\nWill record a video review shortly on it. It's a genuine time saver for anyone that writes sales copy. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç\n\nNone of these types of tools are perfect but this one is really the best one I've played with.\n\niterally the best copywriting software ever!\n\nreat to explore wonderful product\n\nFurthermore, it is the only AI writing tool that has a writing style that specializes in copywriting for direct response marketing.\n\nAdditionally, its founder interacts frequently with the users, gets feedback and releases regular updates for the software. In ClosersCopy, the community is amazing where people help one another and generously share their frameworks in a library that other users can access and use.\n\nThis is truly an amazing platform.\n\nHaving already repaid multiple times over, I consider ClosersCopy one of my best investments. It's also one of my most used tools on a daily basis. This software is a great asset for business owners looking to scale and build their businesses.\n\nHighly recommended!\n\nIt has a very simple and easy-to-use UI, which makes it a joy to work with. It's a bit expensive, but if you're looking for an AI copywriting tool that does more than just rewrite your text, this may be what you're looking for. It's got some powerful features, such as It has three different models of AI: SalesAI, BlogAI, and StoryAI, each one of those trains specific areas. I especially like that they have long-form content and custom frameworks. I think that will be really useful for me and many other copywriters. All in all though, a great product, and I highly recommend it.\n\nIf I get stuck with writing, I know it's like my little buddy out there.I bought this even before the launch of AI (paperwhite)While am more excited about AI features, I love the guidelines templates even more.. I love marketing, and for this, the flow is very essential. It helps me with the flow naturally. I love that it allows me to learn the art of copywriting than anything else.And I must mention, Nico is very open to helping you with your copywriting journey. Whether it's the app, or a skill about copy, he is always there to support you.Thanks for such an amazing product Nico,\n\nNot fun. Any comparative data that‚Ä¶ as far as saving time? AS makes you go through a bunch of questions and then you end up with big text doc that then has to be fully edited and re-designed before it can be used. There is not way to test how effective it is going to be. Would this app be easier that that? I could not find any tutorials or review videos.\n\nOne week later‚Ä¶\n\nI got it and tried it and it is MUCH easier to use. Already did my first project!\n\nI‚Äôm building my first landing sales page and the I learn to this tool, the more I love it. The structure of the sales letter hits all the marks like authority, proof, scarcity, it‚Äôs all there. You can start with a template and build from there. The analysis tool is great, and you can even learn copywriting basics that will help you. All built in. I am benefiting greatly from your work, Nico. Thanks!\n\nIt's also nice that the developer really put importance on a writer's point of view for its features (like the focus). There‚Äôre also helpful features like collaborating with your team to saving your own brilliant template. I hope there would be more template examples to choose from for every category but overall, it's a very useful software.\n\n. As a writer, can't state that enough.. I have seen so many awesome and useful upgrades to this already fantastic AI tool since I bought it, which literally proves how serious and passionate Nico and his team are about Closers Copy and helping the customers. Nico and his support team are amazing too and reply back asap to sort out queries. All the best Nico‚úåüöÄ\n\nThey can literally fit any niche, especially mine. I seem to always get writers block and it causes me to hesitate on certain actions and this has literally helped me get past that. Thank you for helping me get started, thank you for giving me direction.\n\ni! I just purchased your product, and WOA! Just the brief little bit I have dived in so far, it really looks amazing! I just wanted to touch base with you all as well and introduce myself, and also say thank you for such a high quality product at such an affordable price! Best, Spencer Washington\n\nI also love how it doesn't force me into unnatural page breaks since I write for websites.\n\nI own 3 other AI Saas and CloserCopy by far beats them out. Congratulations on building such amazing software.\n\ngreat and very helpful product, really like it!\n\nico Engler, the new editor is superb! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüî•üî•\n\nne of the best ai writing assistant üòç\n\nClosersCopy is the best and valuable investment during my time in the online space. With the new copywriting editor \"Paperwhite\" it is so easy to navigate and finish my Copywriting in minute and all the essential spice of idea is layout with no figuring out what to do next. What I really love the most is the recently launched AI frameworks, I'm using it to brainstorm to write with an AI beside my side knowing that I will not have the writer blocks to the screen and also I like the feature of AI Vault I hope Nico will add more samples in the future it so useful features. Although CloserCopy is Copywriting apps but it should have a feature to write VSL or Video Sales Letter Scripts because it is much needed to put our Copywriting in videos format nowadays, Videos is the medium platform for engagement in media social, I hope Nico will add this feature in CloserCopy and make CloserCopy a Full Solution for all our Copywriting Needs. Lastly I really enjoyed using CloserCopy although I hate writing before now I'm having fun writing for hours .Thanks Nico for this amazing Apps.\n\nBut without the right words to communicate these things to your target audience, no one will care about your business, and therefore, no one will buy. For many, creating powerful and persuasive copy can be the biggest challenge. And in many cases, creating the right copy consumes the most time. ClosersCopy is a great way to speed up the writing process and gather multiple ideas on how to communicate your message, knowing that the templates you're basing your copy from are templates that actually sell, whether you're writing headlines, video copies, blog articles, ad copies, sales letters and many more applications.\n\nYour product is awesome for me. It definitely helped a lot in developing my content writing and copywriting skills. Your software is really impressive. Your editors really engage us to write all through. AI does work to some extent. Not bad either. Sales letters, emails, headlines, power words, product support, and free credits were really cool. Didn't know that a company can really communicate with their clients to this extent with such software. Summing up: I am absolutely satisfied with your product and services. Looking forward towards travelling together to success. Keep rocking! Thanks, Nico\n\nThe templates give me ideas and help get the ball rolling, especially when the client doesn't have a full brief or a prepared outline, which happens often. I've studied copywriting a lot, and have been working actively for more than a year, still, I find myself needing to be reminded of core copy principles that I've just forgotten over time. It's nice to have everything in one place.\n\nIt offers a great workflow to create good content quick, with the tools you need the most at one click of distance, like highlight, outline or even the emotions analyzer which help me get the tone I want to deliver my output for and also to get my content goals by making sure I am using the correct amount of powerful words.\n\n.. It looks very very promising... I love the UI/UX and simplicity of using the app... there are many templates for headlines, copy, hooks, CTA, etc... for sales copy, ads and emails... this looks like a good buy and definitely a keeper for me... I am hoping for more templates to be added to the app in the future...\n\nThe fact that it also gives you an instant analysis on your copy's strength in terms of power words and positive words is an added bonus, and with its features, this app will improve your copy. I definitely recommend ClosersCopy!\n\nI also use it to help me generate headlines for my live streams and course titles. One of my favorite features is the Analysis tool.\n\n\\*\\*minutes later\\*\\*\n\nKabbbooommmm no need to see anymore... I'm keeping this baby. Best money I'll spend this year so thanks for finding me lolol.\n\nThe program is solid and well thought. Very easy to use and with many templates. I really love it! üòòüòòüòò\n\nPricing, features and benefits all add up to an amazing deal for Closers copy. Keep up the good work!\n\nInnovative features make it different from others. I have been using it for a few months now. All the best.\n\nI just tweaked my introduction copy in my sales page and it converted well. üòä\n\nYou are doing a fantastic job of responding to the comments in a personal way. Couldn't help but notice. üôÇ\n\n.. m(\\_ \\_)m Please close this ticket with a smile. \\\\(\\*<>\\*)/ Aloha, Ken\n\nLooking forward to utilize the product.\n\neah, it‚Äôs looking awesome üòÄ (comment on our new editor)\n\nIt bridges the gap and pulls an editor, power word list and so much more together seamlessly. I would fully recommend it to everyone who has a small business and needs those words to be perfect!\n\nPrevious Next\n\nPlus, You‚Äôre Fully Protected By Our 14-Day Money-Back Guarantee\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you aren‚Äôt floored by how easy it is to write your sales pages, ads and email campaigns, I insist you contact my response team for an instant, no-questions asked, FULL refund.\n\nOr if you find another product that has everything that ClosersCopy has at an even lower price than what you‚Äôre getting it for today‚Ä¶ then you are entitled to a full refund during your 14 day test-drive period.\n\nNo questions asked.\n\n*   300 AI Runs / month\n*   50 SEO Audits / month\n*   Limited Updates\n*   2 seats (you + 1 team member)\n*   SEO Audit\n*   SEO Planner\n*   Longform\n*   Frameworks (**700+** to date)\n*   Workflows\n*   Tune (coming soon)\n*   Insights\n*   Email Support\n*   Community (12k+ members)\n\n*   **Unlimited AI Writing** MOST WANTED\n*   **Unlimited SEO Audits** MOST WANTED\n*   **Unlimited Updates** MOST WANTED\n*   3 seats (you + 2 team members)\n*   SEO Audit\n*   SEO Planner\n*   Longform\n*   Frameworks (**700+** to date)\n*   Workflows\n*   Tune (coming soon)\n*   Insights\n*   Email Support\n*   Community (12k+ members)\n\n*   **Unlimited AI Writing** MOST WANTED\n*   **Unlimited SEO Audits** MOST WANTED\n*   **Unlimited Updates** MOST WANTED\n*   5 seats (you + 4 team members)\n*   SEO Audit\n*   SEO Planner\n*   Longform\n*   Frameworks (**700+** to date)\n*   Workflows\n*   Tune (coming soon)\n*   Insights\n*   Email Support\n*   Community (12k+ members)\n\n### And there's more!\n\nDiscover our features table.\n\n[Learn more]()\n\n#### Did you know?\n\nYou can pay monthly or yearly and save 30%.  \nEither way, you'll have immediate access right after purchase.\n\nCompare Your Options\n--------------------\n\n| \n#### Collaboration\n\n |\n| --- |\n| Seats | 2  \nYou + 1 team member | 3  \nYou + 2 team members | 5  \nYou + 4 team members |\n| Community Libraries |  |  |  |\n| \n\n#### Artificial Intelligence\n\n |\n| Runs | 300 / month | **Unlimited** | **Unlimited** |\n| BlogAI |  |  |  |\n| SalesAI |  |  |  |\n| StoryAI |  |  |  |\n| Languages | 128 | 128 | 128 |\n| \n\n#### Flagship Features\n\n |\n| SEO Audits | 50 / month | Unlimited | Unlimited |\n| SEO Planner |  |  |  |\n| Longform |  |  |  |\n| Frameworks (**700+** to date) |  |  |  |\n| Workflows |  |  |  |\n| Tune (coming soon) |  |  |  |\n| Insights |  |  |  |\n| \n\n#### Productivity\n\n |\n| Fluent |  |  |  |\n| Markdown |  |  |  |\n| Swipe |  |  |  |\n| Words |  |  |  |\n| Thesaurus |  |  |  |\n| Shortcuts |  |  |  |\n| \n\n#### Support\n\n |\n| Lifetime Updates |  |  |  |\n| Future Innovations |  |  |  |\n| Email Support |  |  |  |\n| Community (12k+ members) |  |  |  |\n| \n\n#### Languages (AI)\n\n |\n| Afrikaans, Albanian, Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Basque, Belarusian, Bengali, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Cebuano, Chinese, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Corsican, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Dutch (formal), Dutch (informal), English, Esperanto, Estonian, Finnish, French, French (formal), French (informal), Frisian, Galician, Georgian, German, German (formal), German (informal), Greek, Gujarati, Haitian Creole, Hausa, Hawaiian, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong, Hungarian, Icelandic, Igbo, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Italian (formal), Italian (informal), Japanese, Javanese, Kannada, Kazakh, Khmer, Kinyarwanda, Korean, Kurdish, Kyrgyz, Lao, Latvian, Lithuanian, Luxembourgish, Macedonian, Malagasy, Malay, Malayalam, Maltese, Maori, Marathi, Mongolian, Myanmar (Burmese), Nepali, Norwegian, Nyanja (Chichewa), Odia (Oriya), Pashto, Persian, Polish, Polish (formal), Polish (informal), Portuguese, Portuguese (BR), Portuguese (BR) (formal), Portuguese (BR) (informal), Portuguese (Portugal, Brazil), Portuguese (formal), Portuguese (informal), Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Scots Gaelic, Serbian, Sesotho, Shona, Sindhi, Sinhala (Sinhalese), Slovak, Slovenian, Somali, Spanish, Spanish (formal), Spanish (informal), Sundanese, Swahili, Swedish, Tagalog (Filipino), Tajik, Tamil, Tatar, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Turkmen, Ukrainian, Urdu, Uyghur, Uzbek, Vietnamese, Welsh, Xhosa, Yiddish, Yoruba, Zulu |\n\n### Have a question?\n\nClick \"Contact us\" and drop us a message.

Keeping up with work, volunteer, and personal life tasks has become a challenge, and I have been consistently dropping the ball. I have found that with Motion I am dropping that ball less and staying much more focused on what needs to be done, rather than trying to figure out what needs to be done.\n\nVanessa G (Verified User on G2)\n\n![Image 42]()\n\nI don‚Äôt usually write reviews. But Motion is revolutionary. The happiness algorithm they promote states it will help you: feel accomplished, get serious stuff done, and relax and sleep better. Check, check, and check. After week and half of use, I think my productivity is up 10x.\n\njs5993\n\n![Image 43]()\n\nMotion helps me be reasonable with my time. Before Motion, I was just go-go-go. Now, I realize how much I am putting on my plate and how unreasonable I'm being. Motion helps me prioritize my tasks and keep me on track. I use it everyday.\n\nCharlotte R (Verified User on G20)\n\n![Image 44]()\n\nThis app is a game changer\n\nI run a commercial commercial construction company and this app has been a game changer. As far as organization time management and project timelines it is phenomenal. This is probably the only application I use on a daily basis to help organize jobs tasks within jobs and my weekly schedule.\n\nmbxer\n\n![Image 45]()\n\nMotion has been my best friend in overcoming executive dysfunction.\n\nI struggle greatly with procrastination and Motion has been instrumental in my academic and professional successes. Motion has taken the stress away from planning my daily workflow and it has helped me avoid many instances of execution paralysis. This has helped me enjoy my free time more, knowing that I will be able to get everything done on time.\n\nKate B (Verified User on G2)\n\n![Image 46]()\n\nMotion: The app that helps me manage my ADHD\n\nAs someone¬≠ with ADHD who struggles to stay focused and organized, I found gre¬≠at joy in discovering the Motion app. This invaluable tool has be¬≠come a lifeline, allowing me to effectively manage¬≠ projects, priorities, and schedule¬≠s ‚Äî while accommodating my ADHD brain.\n\nFrancis M (Verified User on G2)\n\n![Image 47]()\n\nThe current tool I'm in love with is @useMotion\n\nI used to work 60 hours per week and beat myself to the point of depression but now I work ~40 with same productivity\n\nNot only is it my literal personal assistant scheduling tasks for me, but it rearranges them when life happens\n\n@taayjus\n\n![Image 48]()\n\nAfter a few days with @useMotion, I can see this becoming my go-to app\n\nI dumped all of my tasks into the app with some hard and soft deadlines and it managed to schedule my days beautifully. If things come up and I can't complete the task, it gets re-shuffled!\n\n@MarkPoppen\n\n![Image 49]()\n\nOriginally, I trialed Motion and a competing app. I decided to go with the competitor. But after several months, I had an epiphany of why Motion was better. It handled rescheduling in a much more automated and intuitive way! I switched back and I use it to plan everything.\n\nDmitriNYC\n\n![Image 50]()\n\n![Image 51]()\n\n![Image 52]()\n\n![Image 53]()\n\nManaging a team with aggressive deadlines and big goals?\n\nLet AI plan your team‚Äôs  \nprojects, tasks, and schedules.\n\n![Image 54]()\n\n![Image 55]()\n\nMotion creates the perfect plan automatically\n\nby matching your workload with capacity\n\n![Image 56]()\n\nSave your team members from 10 hours per week wasted in sifting through a sea of projects and tasks\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStudies show that knowledge workers spend more than 20% of their time at work on prioritization, organization, and search, instead of actual work. Instead of wasting hours manually going through hundreds of projects and tasks, your team members only need to look at their calendar for the daily plan generated by Motion‚Äôs A.I. to know their top priorities and start working on actual work.\n\nMotion takes all of your team‚Äôs projects and tasks - and their priorities, deadlines, duration, dependencies, and many other factors - and automatically generates a concrete daily plan for every team member. Motion‚Äôs A.I. eliminates manual planning, coordination, and operational inefficiencies for your entire team.\n\n[Try Motion for free]()\n\n![Image 57]()\n\n100% clarity on what to work on next\n\nso that you are always focusing on the most impactful work.\n\n![Image 58]()\n\nYour team members should always be working on the most impactful work.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMotion‚Äôs A.I. finds the most critical and urgent work for each team member - such as a task that may be the bottleneck in a large project with multiple layers of dependencies - and ensures work is prioritized in a way that maximizes the chance of on-time project delivery.\n\n[Try Motion for free]()\n\n![Image 59]()\n\nFull control and visibility on everything\n\nNo more chaos\n\n![Image 60]()\n\nTrack every team member's daily tasks and what they've accomplished each day\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nView in real-time what everyone is working on. Eliminate time wasted  \non communication and meetings. Instead of feeling awkward and  \n‚Äúmicro-managey‚Äù asking your direct report ‚Äúwhat they are working on‚Äù  \nor ‚Äúwhen will something be done‚Äù, simply look at Motion‚Äôs Team  \nSchedule - which lays out clearly what each person has done and is  \nscheduled to do each day. Create a culture of transparency and  \nalignment within your team.\n\n[Try Motion for free]()\n\n![Image 61]()\n\nAccurately predict the future\n\nNever worry about missing deadlines. Have a peace of mind.\n\n![Image 62]()\n\nNever miss a project deadline. Automate resource and capacity planning.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMotion can predict weeks or even months in advance when a project may miss its deadline, especially when it has layers of complicated dependencies with several bottlenecks. Motion can do this because it understands everything else on your team members‚Äô plate.\n\nMotion‚Äôs AI can automate resource planning for your team by matching your workload and capacity. It can also accurately predict whether you may be over or under-staffed in the future, so you can take actions accordingly (e.g. hire more employees, or take on less projects). When someone asks you when will a project be done - you can answer with confidence using Motion‚Äôs predictive features.\n\n[Try Motion for free]()\n\n![Image 63]()\n\nKeep your plan optimized and up-to-date at all times\n\nNever worry about missing deadlines. Have a peace of mind.\n\n![Image 64]()\n\nA project taking longer than expected? Motion‚Äôs A.I. handles that for you.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges happen all the time: a new project gets created, a task taking longer than expected, a team member is sick, etc. Instead of manually replanning everything all over again after each of these changes, Motion instantly reshuffles the entire team‚Äôs plan on any change, and voila - everything is perfect again.\n\n[Try Motion for free]()\n\n![Image 65]()\n\nAutomate repetitive workflows\n\nWhether it‚Äôs daily work routines or standard operating procedure, Motion can automate it\n\n![Image 66]()\n\nAutomate SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) with Motion‚Äôs Project Workflow Automation Templates\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome of your projects are likely repetitive. Motion allows you to set up powerful project workflow automation templates. When a new project gets created, instead of manually planning and assigning all the tasks to your team members, you can simply use a preset template and everything gets planned and assigned automatically.\n\nMotion can then predict exactly when the project is expected to be finished and track it against other client projects. And as the project progresses, Motion automatically moves it through stages and schedules the corresponding tasks on each team member‚Äôs agenda.\n\n[Try Motion for free]()\n\n![Image 67]()\n\nNo change of habit required\n\n![Image 68]()\n\nYour team members just need to look at their calendar\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nChanging a team member‚Äôs habit and enforcing a new project management system is very difficult - we‚Äôve been in the same boat. That‚Äôs why Motion requires no change of habit from your team members - simply tell them to check their calendar for which tasks to do. This also makes onboarding new team members extremely easy, since checking calendar is already part of everyone‚Äôs habit.\n\nAnd when you assign tasks to team members, instead of emailing, messaging, or meeting to follow-up, you know the task will get done, because it‚Äôs already on their calendar.\n\n[Try Motion for free]()\n\n![Image 69]()\n\nOther softwares bring chaos. Motion streamlines and brings peace.\n\nMotion ensures you‚Äôll never get lost in a sea of projects and tasks\n\n![Image 70]()\n\nDon‚Äôt let yourself and your team members drown in a sea of ill-organized projects and tasks.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen using other project management software like Monday or Asana, things can get out of control quickly - leading to you (as the manager) having to spend hours a week to manually triage and prioritize thousands of tasks inside projects. Motion does not allow this kind of chaos to happen, and uses AI to organize and prioritize work for you automatically.\n\n[Try Motion for free]()\n\n![Image 71]()\n\nCommunication happens right within the project\n\nInstead of flipping back and forth between your company chat app (e.g. Slack) and your project, talk about the project and tag team members right in the project itself - keeping all context in one place.\n\n![Image 72]()\n\nWorld-class teams use Motion\n----------------------------\n\nProject management our team actually uses!\n\n‚ÄúWe had Asana for project management, but our team didn‚Äôt use it regularly. Now, we have Motion and love it. It does everything Asana does and includes tools that make us more efficient. Plus, everyone actually uses it, because it integrates with our calendars.‚Äù\n\n![Image 73]()\n\nAndra Vomir\n\nHead of Content at Efficient App\n\nWe use the mobile app every day!\n\n‚ÄúMost of my team members are on the go, and they‚Äôre not super technical.

We‚Äôve been using Motion for a few months now, and it‚Äôs great.‚Äù\n\n![Image 74]()\n\nSimba Chang\n\nManager at ANANA Properties\n\nSwitching to Motion was completely worth it.\n\n‚ÄúWe were using 15 different tools for tasks, and it was total chaos. When we first considered using Motion, I was worried about the time it would take to switch. But it was completely worth it. Motion saves our company hours each week, and helps us focus on the right tasks and projects.‚Äù\n\n![Image 75]()\n\nCal Hamilton\n\nVice President at ForSitePro\n\nWe‚Äôre finally finishing important projects!\n\n‚ÄúWe would never see projects come to fruition.

VQGAN is an image generator, and CLIP can judge how well the image matches your prompt. CLIP gives feedback to VQGAN on how to make the image more like the text prompt. Repeat this process a few hundred times and some incredible results emerge!\n\n### üì± What platforms does NightCafe Creator work on?\n\nNightCafe Creator's generator works on the web, and can be installed to the home screen of your iPhone, Android phone or tablet.\n\n### üñºÔ∏è Do I own the artworks I create?\n\nYes!

Additionally, the platform provides nine different conversion styles to choose from and the ability to produce images from text. However, Custom Stable Diffusion, which involves fine-tuning pre-existing Stable Diffusion models for specific applications or concepts (pre-trained models such as Arcane Diffusion, Mo-Di Diffusion, Ghibli Diffusion, Tron Legacy Diffusion, Classic Animation Diffusion, and Redshift Diffusion), is currently not available on NightCafe Creator.\n\nLoved By Users\n--------------\n\nRead this review from Jonathan\n\n> I was very pleased with my NightCafe experience. After reading into the OpenAI DALL-E neural net and seeing the creative pieces it was able to manifest I wondered if anywhere was selling AI generated artwork. The idea of a computer creating something new, artistic, and often beautiful is such a novel concept I thought it would be a good conversation piece to have on the wall.\n> \n> It was a pleasant surprise then to find NightCafe, that not only had a curated selection of AI generated prints but also gave me the opportunity to set the parameters for my own pieces. The creative tool was incredibly easy to use and allowed me to \"commission\" one of a kind artwork in a couple minutes and a few clicks. The AI was able combine the japanese ukiyo-e style with a Toronto Raptors logo and a photo of Michael Phelps and create something fascinating, unique, and worthy of being displayed.\n> \n> For me to have the same degree of creative freedom and quality of execution in a brand-new piece of art would cost hundreds in commission and weeks of waiting at the very minimum.\n> \n> The technology behind NightCafe gives everyone the ability to create something special even if they aren't particularly artistically inclined, and does so at an affordable price.\n> \n> I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of creating the pieces and also appreciated being able to see other artwork created by community members. You could easily fill an exhibition gallery with quality pieces from the NightCafe community before long!\n> \n> ‚Äî Jonathan\n\nStart Creating",

Other tools like RunwayML and Synthesia can generate visual-to-video footage with a text prompt and a reference image or human-like AI avatars.\n\n### What is the best text to video converter?\n\nThe \"best\" tool depends on your needs. We recommend Kapwing's text to video AI converter because you can get started for free.

You can chop away any unwanted segments, cut out ads, remove the opening or closing, or divide a long video into small pieces. It is easy to make a rough cut out of 4K and even 8K footage with Level-3 Hardware Acceleration.\n    \n*   #### Merge\n    \n    Even videos shot by different devices or encoded differently can be joined in batches using VideoProc Converter AI. It helps you quickly change or unify resolutions, aspect ratios, playback speeds, volumes, etc., and combine videos into one file. Combine the automatically divided GoPro/DJI/camera clips to form a rough cut.\n    \n*   #### Crop\n    \n    It allows you to choose from the aspect ratio presets (widescreen/16:9/4:3/1:1) to fit different platforms and players. You can remove black borders, get rid of cluttered backgrounds, improve the image composition, or zoom in and highlight the focal point. The real-time preview enables you to see the results in real-time.\n    \n*   #### Rotate/Flip\n    \n    One click to rotate or flip: you can rotate your video left or right (clockwise or counter-clockwise) 90, 180, or 270 degrees to a proper direction, or mirror flip clips vertically or horizontally to get an creative effect.\n    \n*   #### Effects\n    \n    The 16 built-in special effect filters can turn ordinary into cinematic. You can add Grayscale, Painting, Sharpen, and blur effects, give your video a retro look in one click, or apply some stylized effects such as Mirror and Noise.\n    \n*   #### Pre-process\n    \n    As a lightweight software, VideoProc is a good way for pre-processing. It de-shakes videos with minimum image cropping, allowing you to set stabilization parameters accurately; removes wind and background noises; corrects fisheye lens distortion to get a realistic look.\n    \n*   #### Co-process\n    \n    Make the file size of your footage or final cuts smaller flexibly and efficiently. Change GOP value for efficient compression, or set CBR/VBR, change codecs, fps, resolutions, audio sample rates, and other parameters to customize output file size and quality. No rendering is needed.\n    \n\n*   **Color** Fine-tune Brightness, Contrast, Hue, Gamma, and Saturation.\n*   **Audio** Adjust audio volume, force A/V sync, set audio delay, etc.\n*   **Speed** Change video speed, generate a slow/fast-motion video.\n*   **Watermark** Watermark your video with text, logo, image, or timecode.\n\n### Download Media\n\nDownload videos, music, subtitles, and live streaming videos from 1000+ popular sites and 2000+ niche sites.

Now that I have this software, everything is as easy as finger snapping.\n\n### Giger\n\nE-commerce Amazon/Ebay\n\nWhen we have a huge volume of photos coming in and our clients are waiting for professional editing in urgency, we often use cutout.pro to greatly boost the efficiency of our work by using it for batch automatic editing first. Then our experts will handle the details to add the final touch and fine-tune the results. It really improved our workflow. - [read full review]()\n\n### Eva Williams\n\njournalist for fixthephoto.com\n\nI work for an agency in digitization. I have to process dozens of videos everyday. Removing video background manually is a nightmare. I was so excited to discover the automatic video background removal tool by cutout.pro and amazed by the cutout quality for even HD videos. What really made me happy is that we no longer have to use green screens for our campaign videos. It truly improves my work efficiency and productivity. Great work, cutout.pro!\n\nWe need the flexibility to remove distracting video backgrounds for some of our Church announcements or promo videos. I've tried a few other software but I find cutout.pro the most effective so far. I also use cutout.pro to create flyers for our church events and our church newsletter, which saves much more time than Photoshop.\n\n### Joel\n\nWNTCG church in London\n\nI have been doing print-on-demand business for 11 years and doing the designs by myself. It‚Äôs painful to customize products as the orders grow rapidly. It is very difficult to find so many designers to handle orders in a short period of time. The face cutout tool gives me time to breathe. The new cartoonizer feature is superb and printing avatars is fun. The kids absolutely love it. I have gained much more traffic and 47% increase in sales since the integration with cutout.pro‚Äôstechnology. Thank you!\n\n### Flying\n\nPOD print on demand\n\nCutout.pro background remover helps photographers on our photography and camera review site [Shotkit.com](/) to batch edit picture backgrounds. Even someone with no editing experience can change the image background colour without any Photoshop skills. Highly recommended!\n\n### Mark Condon\n\nCEO of Shotkit.com",

Slidesgo comes to the rescue with its latest functionality‚Äîthe AI presentation maker! With a few clicks, you‚Äôll have **wonderful slideshows that suit your own needs**. And **it‚Äôs totally free!**\n\nGet started How does it work?\n\n![Image 2]() ![Image 3]()\n\nElegant Education Pack for Students\n\n![Image 4]()\n\n![Image 5]()\n\n### Generate presentations in minutes\n\nWe humans make the world move, but we need to sleep, rest and so on. What if there were someone available 24/7 for you? It‚Äôs time to get out of your comfort zone and ask the AI presentation maker to give you a hand. **The possibilities are endless**: you choose the topic, the tone and the style, and the AI will do the rest. **Now we‚Äôre talking!**\n\n### Customize your AI-generated presentation online\n\nAlright, your robotic pal has generated a presentation for you. But, for the time being, AIs can‚Äôt read minds, so it‚Äôs likely that you‚Äôll want to modify the slides. Please do! We didn‚Äôt forget about those time constraints you‚Äôre facing, so thanks to the **editing tools** provided by one of our sister projects ‚Äîshoutouts to **Wepik**‚Äî you can **make changes on the fly** without resorting to other programs or software. Add text, choose your own colors, rearrange elements, it‚Äôs up to you! Oh, and since we are a big family, you‚Äôll be able to access many resources from big names, that is, **Freepik and Flaticon**. That means having a lot of **images and icons at your disposal!**\n\n![Image 6]()\n\nHow does it work?\n-----------------\n\n### Think of your topic\n\nFirst things first, you‚Äôll be talking about something in particular, right? A business meeting, a new medical breakthrough, the weather, your favorite songs, a basketball game, a pink elephant you saw last Sunday‚Äîyou name it. **Just type it out and let the AI know what the topic is.**\n\n### Choose your preferred style and tone\n\nThey say that variety is the spice of life. That‚Äôs why we let you choose between different design styles, including **doodle, simple, abstract, geometric, and elegant**. What about the tone? Several of them: fun, creative, casual, professional, and formal. Each one will give you something unique, so which way of impressing your audience will it be this time? Mix and match!\n\n### Make any desired changes\n\nYou‚Äôve got freshly generated slides. Oh, you wish they were in a different color? That text box would look better if it were placed on the right side? **Run the online editor and use the tools** to have the slides exactly your way.\n\n### Download the final result for free\n\nYes, just as envisioned those slides deserve to be on your storage device at once! You can export the presentation in **.pdf format and download it for free**. Can‚Äôt wait to show it to your best friend because you think they will love it? **Generate a shareable link!**\n\nFAQs\n----\n\nWhat is an AI-generated presentation?\n\nIt‚Äôs exactly ‚Äúwhat it says on the cover‚Äù. AIs, or artificial intelligences, are in constant evolution, and they are now able to generate presentations in a short time, based on inputs from the user. This technology allows you to get a satisfactory presentation much faster by doing a big chunk of the work.\n\nCan I customize the presentation generated by the AI?\n\nOf course! That‚Äôs the point! Slidesgo is all for customization since day one, so you‚Äôll be able to make any changes to presentations generated by the AI. We humans are irreplaceable, after all! Thanks to the online editor, you can do whatever modifications you may need, without having to install any software. Colors, text, images, icons, placement, the final decision concerning all of the elements is up to you.\n\nCan I add my own images?\n\nAbsolutely. That‚Äôs a basic function, and we made sure to have it available. Would it make sense to have a portfolio template generated by an AI without a single picture of your own work? In any case, we also offer the possibility of asking the AI to generate images for you via prompts. Additionally, you can also check out the integrated gallery of images from Freepik and use them. If making an impression is your goal, you‚Äôll have an easy time!\n\nIs this new functionality free? As in ‚Äúfree of charge‚Äù? Do you mean it?\n\nYes, it is, and we mean it. We even asked our buddies at Wepik, who are the ones hosting this AI presentation maker, and they told us ‚Äúyup, it‚Äôs on the house‚Äù.\n\nAre there more presentation designs available?\n\nFrom time to time, we‚Äôll be adding more designs. The cool thing is that you‚Äôll have at your disposal a lot of content from Freepik and Flaticon when using the AI presentation maker. Oh, and just as a reminder, if you feel like you want to do things yourself and don‚Äôt want to rely on an AI, you‚Äôre on Slidesgo, the leading website when it comes to presentation templates. We have thousands of them, and counting!.\n\nHow can I download my presentation?\n\nThe easiest way is to click on ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù to get your presentation in .pdf format. But there are other options! You can click on ‚ÄúPresent‚Äù to enter the presenter view and start presenting right away! There‚Äôs also the ‚ÄúShare‚Äù option, which gives you a shareable link. This way, any friend, relative, colleague‚Äîanyone, really‚Äîwill be able to access your presentation in a moment.\n\nDiscover more content\n\nThis is just the beginning! Slidesgo has thousands of customizable templates for Google Slides and PowerPoint. Our designers have created them with much care and love, and the variety of topics, themes and styles is, how to put it, immense! We also have a blog, in which we post articles for those who want to find inspiration or need to learn a bit more about Google Slides or PowerPoint. Do you have kids? We‚Äôve got a section dedicated to printable coloring pages!

In parallel, we have also been developing technology around video since 2014, starting with automated rendering on After Effects (Veeroll). During covid, we also launched a productised service to create videos for social media (VideoBlast.io).\n\nThe combination of skills and experience we have developed as a team over the past 10 years is what led us to also launch **StoryboardHero**. We used to spend days on coming up with concepts, writing scripts and creating storyboards. It was not only time consuming but also quite expensive. Until we created StoryboardHero, our **AI storyboard generator**, to make it easier and faster for our team to create concepts and storyboards.\n\nLearn more about StoryboardHero, the all-in-one AI Storyboard Generator.\n\n![Image 4]()\n\n### The best AI Storyboard Generator for consistency of characters\n\nWhy you need storyboards\n------------------------\n\n#### If you are a video agency, you probably already know the benefits of using storyboards:\n\n![Image 5]()\n\n‚Ä¢ Our brains like images: when you pitch an idea to a prospect with visuals, you drastically increase your chances of converting this prospect into a client. And the more storyboards you can create, the more prospects you can convert.\n\n![Image 6]()\n\n‚Ä¢ Once you sign a contract, you‚Äôd better make sure you are fully aligned on the concept, script and visuals, before you start creating the assets to animate or you start filming. Otherwise you end up with many revisions that eat into your margin.\n\n#### With StoryboardHero, you can:\n\n![Image 7]()\n\n‚Ä¢ Create more storyboards, faster and cheaper, without burdening your team.\n\n![Image 8]()\n\n‚Ä¢ Iterate faster on storyboards to save time and be aligned with clients on projects.\"\n\nJoin StoryboardHero and start creating storyboards with an all-in-one AI Storyboard Generator.\n\nWhat our users say about StoryboardHero\n---------------------------------------\n\nBefore using StoryboardHero, creating storyboard was a long, manual and rather disorganised process. From coming with concepts, then drafting scripts, then having someone in the team sketch images. It would require several iterations and take several days. Since we started using StoryboardHero, the process has not only been shortened drastically but AI has also helped us coming up with more ideas. We can come back to clients and prospects much faster.\n\n![Image 9: Bryony Allen]()\n\nBryony AllenGeneral Manager, fewStones (Corporate Video Agency)\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n###### What is an AI Storyboard Generator? In what way is it different from ChatGPT?\n\nAn AI Storyboard Generator is an online platform to create storyboards using AI. It is now possible to generate scripts and images separately using AI platforms but StoryboardHero goes beyond that in several ways: creation of structured script (including voice over, camera angle, transitions,,,), seamless integration of script generation with storyboard structure, options to have our team sketch images if you are not satisfied with AI images, and more. Instead of using different tools to generate AI storyboards, StoryboardHero provides a simple and specialized solution.\n\n###### Why should I move from a manual storyboarding process to using an AI Storyboard Generator?\n\nArtificial intelligence tools will help improve creativity and productivity in many sectors. For video agencies and video creators, being an early adopter of an AI Storyboard Generator can help you save time when delivering to clients, improving their experience with you. It can also enable you to pitch more prospects with storyboards and win more business.\n\n###### Can I use these AI storyboards with my clients?\n\nYes. You have the full rights to use the storyboards generated by StoryboardHero with your clients. The PDF storyboards you can generate in the platform have only your branding and do not mention \"AI storyboard\" or StoryboardHero anywhere.\n\n###### Are there some limitations when generating storyboards with AI?\n\nAI technology is evolving fast but it‚Äôs still facing some limitations (for instance when you generate images with multiple actions). That‚Äôs why StoryboardHero offers options to help generate full storyboards. In the scripting part, you can edit the scripts or regenerate them. In the image generation part, you can also regenerate images or use our team of storyboard sketch artists when needed. We keep improving StoryboardHero as AI technology evolves to make it the perfect AI Storyboard Generator. Your suggestions are also welcome.\n\n###### Is StoryboardHeo a script-to-storyboard generator?\n\nYes, StoryboardHero includes a script-to-storyboard feature. But our AI storyboard generator goes beyond just script-to-storyboard. With StoryboardHero, you can generate the script as well: just input a short brief and our AI will generate a script divided in scenes for you. From there you move on to the next step which is a script-to-storyboard feature to get your visuals.\n\n###### How does an AI Storyboard Generator work?\n\nOur tool is very straightforward. If you already have a script ready, simply input the script into the platform, and it will automatically generate a storyboard for you in a matter of minutes. If you don‚Äôt have a script, you can put in a short brief and our AI will come up with a script for you. From there, you can move on to generate visuals for your storyboard.\n\n###### Can an AI Storyboard Generator customize storyboards for different styles?\n\nYes, simply indicate your desired style in the project brief, our AI will create storyboards in that style.\n\n###### What Input is Required for the AI Storyboard Generator?\n\nIf you already have a script, you can upload a csv file to the platform. We have a simple script template that makes it super easy for you to indicate to our AI what your script is about.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use our tool to get some ideas for your video script and storyboard. Just write some details about the project brief, choose your desired duration, video style and video type in the user-friendly interface. You will also have the option to add a link to a reference video.\n\n###### What Visual Styles and Artistic Elements can your Storyboard Generator Incorporate?\n\nIt depends on the type of video you want to create. We provide a wide array of styles. For example, for 2D animation videos, you can choose from 15 different styles including pencil sketch, comic book, anime, photo realistic and more.\n\n###### How Long Does it Take to Generate a Storyboard Using AI?\n\nMere minutes üòâ\n\n###### How much control do I have over the result?\n\n100%! Our tool simply makes it faster and easier to flesh out your ideas. You have complete control over the style, duration and the content. You can modify the script, delete redundant frames, add new frames and reorder them as much as you like.\n\n###### Can StoryboardHero‚Äôs AI Storyboard Generator Handle Collaborative Workflows?\n\nDefinitely. You have the option to share a link to the storyboard with your team or clients to comment on. You can also export it as a pdf or motion picture screenplay.\n\n###### Do StoryboardHero‚Äôs AI Offer Suggestions for Story Improvement?\n\nUnfortunately, our tool is not able to offer suggestions at the moment.\n\n###### Can I edit the scripts and storyboards?\n\nYes, you can! At any time, you can make adjustments to the generated results. If you are not 100% happy with what you have, you can regenerate the entire script or individual frames. The same goes for storyboards. Once our AI tool has created the storyboard, you can ask it to re-generate the whole project or a single frame. If what you have in mind goes beyond the capability of AI, our in-house designers are at your service. They will be able to help you draw that specific scene.\n\n###### Can I use StoryboardHero even though I don‚Äôt have a design and video production background?\n\nDefinitely. We believe you‚Äôll love the tool even more because of that. Our goal is to make it easy for anyone to create storyboards, so rest assured, you don‚Äôt need to be a pro to use it.

    "name": "GPTZero",

    "desc": "GPTZero, a user-friendly AI detector with a 52% accuracy rate, offers basic AI content detection. It features a streamlined interface and quick checks, targeting specific AI models. Integration with MS Word and learning systems is ideal for educators. GPTZero is free, no sign-up required. Key features include ChatGPT plagiarism checks, sentence analysis, text spam detection, and search engine support.",
    "homepage": "Title: The Trusted AI Detector for ChatGPT, GPT-4, & More | GPTZero\n\nURL Source: \n\nMarkdown Content:\n### What is GPTZero?\n\nGPTZero is the [leading AI detector](/) for checking whether a document was written by a large language model such as ChatGPT. GPTZero detects AI on sentence, paragraph, and document level. Our model was trained on a large, diverse corpus of human-written and AI-generated text, with a focus on English prose. To date, GPTZero has served over 2.5 million users around the world, and works with over 100 organizations in education, hiring, publishing, legal, and more.\n\n### How do I use GPTZero?\n\nSimply paste in the text you want to check, or upload your file, and we'll return an overall detection for your document, as well as sentence-by-sentence highlighting of sentences where we've detected AI. Unlike other detectors, we help you interpret the results with a description of the result, instead of just returning a number.\n\nTo get the power of our AI detector for larger texts, or a batch of files, sign up for a free account on our¬†[Dashboard](/).\n\nIf you want to run the AI detector as your browse, you can download our¬†[Chrome Extension, Origin](), which allows you to scan the entire page in one click.\n\n### When should I use GPTZero?\n\nOur users have seen the use of AI-generated text proliferate into education, certification, hiring and recruitment, social writing platforms, disinformation, and beyond. We've created GPTZero as a tool to highlight the possible use of AI in writing text. In particular, we focus on classifying AI use in prose.\n\nOverall, our classifier is intended to be used to flag situations in which a conversation can be started (for example, between educators and students) to drive further inquiry and spread awareness of the risks of using AI in written work.\n\n### Does GPTZero only detect ChatGPT outputs?\n\nNo, GPTZero works robustly across a range of AI language models, including but not limited to ChatGPT, GPT-4, GPT-3, GPT-2, LLaMA, and AI services based on those models.\n\n### Why GPTZero over other detection models?\n\n*   GPTZero is the most accurate AI detector across use-cases, verified by multiple independent sources, including TechCrunch, which called us [the best and most reliable AI detector]() after testing seven others.\n*   GPTZero builds and constantly improves our own technology. In our competitor analysis, we found that not only does GPTZero perform better, some competitor services are actually just forwarding the outputs of free, open-source models without additional training.\n*   In contrast to many other models, GPTZero is finetuned for student writing and academic prose. By doing so, we've seen large improvements in accuracies for this use-case.\n\nLastly, many of our users - especially educators - have told us they trust GPTZero because we have only one mission: provide every human with the tools to detect and safely adopt AI technologies. Unlike many providers who recently released detectors as a side product, this mission will always be our number one priority.\n\n### What are the limitations of the classifier?\n\nThe nature of AI-generated content is changing constantly. As such, these results should not be used to punish students. We recommend educators to use our behind-the-scene [Writing Reports]() as part of a holistic assessment of student work. There always exist edge cases with both instances where AI is classified as human, and human is classified as AI. Instead, we recommend educators take approaches that give students the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding in a controlled environment and craft [assignments that cannot be solved with AI]().\n\nThe accuracy of our model increases as more text is submitted to the model. As such, the accuracy of the model on the document-level classification will be greater than the accuracy on the paragraph-level, which is greater than the accuracy on the sentence level.\n\nThe accuracy of our model also increases for text similar in nature to our dataset. While we train on a highly diverse set of human and AI-generated text, the majority of our dataset is in English prose, written by adults.\n\nOur classifier is not trained to identify AI-generated text after it has been heavily modified after generation (although we estimate this is a minority of the uses for AI-generation at the moment).\n\nCurrently, our classifier can sometimes flag other machine-generated or highly procedural text as AI-generated, and as such, should be used on more descriptive portions of text.\n\n### What can I do as an educator to reduce the risk of AI misuse?\n\nWe believe that the best outcome for educators and students arrives by working together proactively to understand the problem of AI misuse and find strategies that hone in on the human value of education. For example, educators can:\n\n1.  Help students understand the risks of using AI in their work (to learn more, see [this article](/))), and value of learning to express themselves. For example, in real-life, real-time collaboration, pitching, and debate, how does your class improve their ability to communicate when AI is not available?\n2.  Create an assessment that cannot be answered by Chat GPT or other AI. For example:\n    *   Ask students to write about personal experiences and how they relate to the text, or reflect on their learning experience in your class.\n    *   Ask students to critique the default answer given by Chat GPT to your question.\n    *   Require that students cite real, primary sources of information to back up their specific claims, or ask them to write about recent events.\n    *   Assess students based on a live discussion with their peers, and use peer assessment tools (such as the one provided by our partner, [Peerceptiv](/)).\n    *   Ask students to complete their assignments in class or in an interactive way, and shift lectures to be take-home.\n3.  Ask students to produce multiple drafts of their work that they can revise as peers or through the educator, to help students understand that assignments are meant to teach a learning process.\n4.  Ask students to produce work in a medium that is difficult to generate, such as powerpoint presentations, visual displays, videos, or audio recordings.\n5.  Set expectations for your students that you will be checking the work through an AI detector like GPTZero, to deter misuse of AI.\n\n### I'm an educator who has found AI-generated text by my students. What do I do?\n\nFirstly, at GPTZero, we don't believe that any AI detector is perfect. There always exist edge cases with both instances where AI is classified as human, and human is classified as AI. Nonetheless, we recommend that educators can do the following when they get a positive detection:\n\n1.  Ask students to demonstrate their understanding in a controlled environment, whether that is through an in-person assessment, or through an editor that can track their edit history (for instance, using our [Writing Reports]() through Google Docs). Check out our list of [several recommendations]() on types of assignments that are difficult to solve with AI.\n2.  Ask the student if they can produce artifacts of their writing process, whether it is drafts, revision histories, or brainstorming notes. For example, if the editor they used to write the text has an edit history (such as Google Docs), and it was typed out with several edits over a reasonable period of time, it is likely the student work is authentic. You can use GPTZero's [Writing Reports]() to replay the student's writing process, and view signals that indicate the authenticity of the work.\n3.  See if there is a history of AI-generated text in the student's work. We recommend looking for a long-term pattern of AI use, as opposed to a single instance, in order to determine whether the student is using AI.\n\n### What data did you train your model on?\n\nOur model is trained on millions of documents spanning various domains of writing including creating writing, scientific writing, blogs, news articles, and more. We test our models on a never-before-seen set of human and AI articles from a section of our large-scale dataset, in addition to a smaller set of challenging articles that are outside its training distribution.\n\n### How do I use and interpret the results from your API?\n\nTo see the full schema and try examples yourself, check out our¬†[API documentation.](/)\n\nOur API returns a `document_classification` field which indicates the most likely classification of the document. The possible values are `HUMAN_ONLY`, `MIXED`, and `AI_ONLY`. We also provide a probability for each classification, which is returned in the `class_probabilities` field. The keys for this field are `human`, `ai` or `mixed`. To get the probability for the most likely classification, the `predicted_class` field can be used. The class probability corresponding to the predicted class can be interpreted as the chance that the detector is correct in its classification. I.e. 90% means that 90% of the time on similar documents our detector is correct in the prediction it makes. Lastly, each prediction comes with a `confidence_category` field, which can be `high`, `medium`, or `low`. Confidence categories are tuned such that when the `confidence_category`field is `high` 99.1% of human articles are classified as human, and 98.4% of AI articles are classified as AI.\n\nAdditionally, we highlight sentences that been detected to be written by AI. API users can access this highlighting through the `highlight_sentence_for_ai` field. The sentence-level classification should not be solely used to indicate that an essay contains AI (such as ChatGPT plagiarism). Rather, when a document gets a `MIXED` or` AI_ONLY` classification, the highlighted sentence will indicate where in the document we believe this occurred.\n\n### Are you storing data from API calls?\n\nNo. We do not store or collect the documents passed into any calls to our API. We wanted to be overly cautious on the side of storing data from any organizations using our API.\n\nHowever, we do store inputs from calls made from our dashboard. This data is only used in aggregate by GPTZero to further improve the service for our users. You can refer to our\n\n[privacy policy]()\n\nfor more details.\n\n### How do I cite GPTZero for an academic paper?\n\nYou can use the following bibtex citation:\n\n```\n@misc{tian2024gptzero,\n    publisher = {GPTZero},\n    url       = {},\n    year      = {2024},\n    author    = {Tian, Edward and Cui, Alexander},\n    title     = {GPTZero: Towards detection of AI-generated text using zero-shot and supervised methods}\n}\n```",

They are not a measure on the amount of AI vs amount of Original content in a given text.\n\nWe recommend not applying a similar ‚Äúhard‚Äù rule when it comes to working with AI scores and writers. If a writer consistently has high Originality scores but then on one article has a higher AI score, this could very likely be a false positive and further investigation should occur.\n\n‚Äç[Here](/) is our guidance on how to interpret the AI scores for writers.\n\n[Does Originality.ai Provide Paraphrase Detection? ![Image 61](#)\n\nYes, Originality.ai‚Äôs AI is the only available AI that has been trained to detect if content has been paraphrased with a tool like Quillbot. If a piece of text, regardless of whether it started as AI or Human, is run through a paraphrasing tool like Quillbot Originality.ai will identify the content as AI generated 95% of the time.\n\nRead more about [Paraphrase Plagiarism Checker](/)\n\nSee a quick live test: [)\n\nThe image below shows the detection accuracy for our Paraphrase Checker:\n\n![Image 62]()\n\n[What Can Cause False Positives? ![Image 63](#)\n\nFalse positives in AI detection do occur and we are sorry if Originality.ai identified your content as AI. It is different for every tool and a specific reason on what the AI identified as causing it to predict the con\n\nHere are 7 tips for minimizing false positives‚Ä¶\n\n1.  A detection score of 60% Original and 40% AI is not a false positive. It correctly predicted with 60% confidence that your content was Original. The [meaning of the score](/) is not that 60% was Original and 40% was AI it means it is 60% confident the content is Original.\n2.  Editing AI-written content is not a false positive - it is a true positive\n3.  Having AI edit your work is not a false positive - it is a true positive\n4.  When any amount of AI touches the content it can cause the entire article to be flagged as AI\n5.  ‚ÄúCyborg‚Äù writing where a lot of AI tools are used to create an outline, suggest edits, optimize the content can increase the chance of a higher AI score.¬†(For this reason we created a [free content optimizer](/) tool similar to SurferSEO or MarketMuse but 100% free that does not use AI to reduce the chance of a false positive occurring.)\n6.  Strange formatting can reduce the accuracy of the detector tools causing an increase in false positives or false negatives.¬†\n7.  The shorter the text the less accurate the detection score. We recommend at least 100 words being checked.¬†\n\nWe apologize if our tool has incorrectly identified your writing as AI!\n\n[What do you do if you have been falsely accused of using AI? ![Image 64](#)\n\n*   **See our in depth guide on avoiding and managing** [**AI detector false positives**]()¬†\n*   **Students** - Make sure your teacher is educated on the current [AI detection accuracy](/). Provide any details you have on the creation process. Using a Google Document and providing a screen recording. An AI detection score alone should not be used for academic integrity discipline.¬†\n*   **Writers** - Create your content in a Google Document and share the free Originality.ai chrome extension with your clients so that if there is any False Positive you can prove you created the document. Share how we recommend people [use the AI detection score](/). AI detection is not the same as plagiarism checking and should have a more nuanced approach to what is and is not acceptable.¬†¬†¬†¬†\n*   **Agencies** - The first thing any content agency needs to be doing is to define if it is acceptable for writers to use AI and if it is not then develop a process for checking. If you are choosing to use AI in producing content then make sure to communicate that transparently with clients. If you have clients that have accused your agency of having content produced by AI rather than human than refer to your company's policy/procedure for checking work and show the scan history of the writers work.¬†\n\n[False Positives - What Do I Do If I Have Been Falsely Accused of Using AI? ![Image 65](#)\n\nA false positive is when human-written content is identified as AI-written text by an AI detector. False positives do occur and can cause a lot of pain. Across hundreds of thousands of tests we currently see false positives occurring about 2% of the time that human work is submitted.\n\n2% false positives, despite being the lowest in the industry based on [our accuracy test](/), is too high.\n\nThe AI researchers and machine learning engineers at Originality are working constantly to both improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives.\n\nWe are heavily focused on equipping writers with tools to help them prove their contents Originality.\n\nIt was for the purpose of helping writers prove that their work was original that we developed a free Chrome Extension that allows anyone to visualise the creation process of a Google **Document**\n\n[Free AI Detection Chrome Extension](/)\n\n![Image 66]()\n\n[How Does Originality.ai Compare to Other AI Content Detectors? ![Image 67](#)\n\nOriginality.ai is the most accurate AI content detector producing the fewest false positives while also the only tool that accurately identifies a piece of content (human or AI) that has been paraphrased.\n\nSee the complete study analyzing how Originality.ai matches up in detection capabilities to other AI detectors here - [See Case Study](/).\n\nThe image below shows the results of a test of 1200 text samples, 600 AI generated and 600 human generated tested across multiple AI detectors:\n\n![Image 68]()\n\nThe table below shows the features Originality.ai has including‚Ä¶\n\n*   AI Detection\n*   Plagiarism Checking\n*   Paraphrase Detection (only tool to offer this)\n\n![Image 69]()\n\nOriginality.ai is more than an AI detector.

Each prediction our AI makes on a test data set is grouped into one of four buckets‚Ä¶\n\n*   True Positive - AI detector **correctly** identified AI content as AI\n*   False Negative - AI detector **incorrectly** identified AI content as Human\n*   False Positive - AI detector **incorrectly** identified Human content as AI\n*   True Negative - AI detector **correctly** identified Human content as Human\n\nThe image below shows the confusion matrix for Originality tested on GPT-4 generated content.\n\n![Image 71]()\n\n[What is AI Generated Text? ![Image 72](#)\n\nAI-generated text is words that have been written by Artificial Intelligence (AI) specifically using Large Language Models (LLMs). The most common example is OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT which is an AI using [OpenAI‚Äôs NLP Models](/) (GPT-3, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) to understand a users prompt and provide a written response.\n\nFor the purposes of AI text detection we aim to flag any content that has been meaningfully changed by AI.

The AI learns the nuances of human language, identifies patterns that differentiate human and AI writing, makes predictions about new text, assigns a score indicating the likelihood of human or AI authorship, and continuously improves through updated training data.\n\n### [What's the difference between Plagiarism Checkers and AI Writing Detectors?](#)\n\nPlagiarism detection refers to the process of identifying instances of plagiarism, which is the act of using someone else‚Äôs work or ideas without giving them proper credit. This can include text, images, or other forms of media.\n\nAI detection, on the other hand, refers to the use of artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT to generate copy.\n\n### [Are AI detection tools accurate?](#)\n\nAI detectors have been developed to determine if online content is human or machine-generated, though their effectiveness currently varies. Winston AI has [by far the best percentage rate](/) (99,98%) of detecting AI generated content from ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, and other popular text generation tools.\n\nAs the technology improves, AI content detectors are expected to become more accurate and help ensure the authenticity of online information.\n\n### [Does Google detect AI content?](#)\n\nAI text generators have raised concerns about the impact of AI-generated content on SEO (search engine optimization). While AI-generated content threatens to produce low-quality spam, search engines like Google are improving algorithms to detect such content.\n\n### [What does Winston do exactly?](#)\n\nWinston is the leading AI generated text detection tool. Our software is able to detect AI generated copy with a [99,98% accuracy](/) including content generated by ChatGPT.

Customers would ask me for designs and we‚Äôd print them on t-shirts. Pretty straight forward, except for the fact that I dealt with a common problem faced by designers of any kind:\n\nCustomers always have a problem with the designs you send them.\n\nI‚Äôd design art and send it to the customer. They‚Äôd not like some part of the design and ask for changes. But that‚Äôs an additional $50/hour for design work that the customer wasn‚Äôt willing to pay for. So we‚Äôd end up losing a lot of business over customers thinking they know design better than professional designers.\n\nSome years later, I got into SEO. And when doing SEO, search engines rank web pages higher the longer a reader spends on the page. One way to increase ‚Äútime on page‚Äù is to make the content interactive by including custom images like graphs, infographics, designs etc.\n\nBut good designers are expensive and they work SLOW. We could write a fantastic article in hours but graphic design took days.\n\nPlus, much of the SEO work I did was generating traffic for SaaS products. One day I realized, hey, if I‚Äôm so good at getting traffic for SaaS products, why don‚Äôt I build my own? That‚Äôs how I became a SaaS founder.\n\nArtSmart AI isn‚Äôt my first SaaS but it‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm most excited about. And lucky for us, anything to do with AI is mui caliente right now. So the growth ArtSmart AI has seen since launch is unreal.\n\nBut don‚Äôt get the wrong idea. We aren‚Äôt some fly-by-night entrepreneurs looking to cash-in on the AI wave. My team and I are all-in on ArtSmart AI for the long haul. Our users are an endless well of ideas, so we‚Äôre shipping new features almost at breakneck speed. And since we‚Äôre part of the open source community, ArtSmart AI improves with every update to the models we built and trained out software on.\n\nThe generative AI space is brand new and new apps are launching every week. We‚Äôre witnessing history in the making and we‚Äôre honored to play our part in it.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to us.\n\n*   Do we have Commercial Rights?\n    \n    TLDR;\n    \n    You have 100% commercial rights - you can use generated images anywhere at the time of this writing.\n    \n    Monetizing celebrities public figures and other notable fictional characters that are the creation of others could get you in trouble.\n    \n    Creating realistic images with the intent to deceive others that a fictional event took place that didn‚Äôt occur in reality could result in defamation (aka hurting somenes reputation). Honestly though the models are not exactly capable of producing deep fake images so not much to worry about here YET. The models do improve quickly.\n    \n    However you free to meme for non monetary purpose.\n    \n*   How does the credit system work?\n    \n    For each AI generated image a large amount of compute power is required. Instead of boring you with technical jargon we created a credit system. 1 credit usually means 1 image produced or 1 call to the algorightm.\n    \n    Some models require up to 20x the amount of compute power. For these we have assigned a equal amount of credit cost.\n    \n    More advanced settings can require more models.\n    \n*   Where is my data stored?\n    \n    Data is stored securely on servers in the United States, by vetted, highly secure, third party partners of us.\n    \n*   Can I get a refund?\n    \n    Yes, we can refund purchases made within the first 30 days, provided you haven‚Äôt trained the AI yet. After 30 days or once a plan is used, it is no longer eligible for a refund. Please refer to our Terms of Service for details.\n    \n*   Is payment secure?\n    \n    Yes, we use Stripe for payment. We do not store any of your credit card information.\n    \n*   Can I use my image anywhere?\n    \n    Yes, you can use your image anywhere you want. You generated a 100% custom and unique image. It is yours to resell.\n    \n\n[START PROMPTING]()\n\n[Get Started Now]( Day Money Back Guarantee, We don't offer a free trial\n\n[![Image 48: artsmart.ai logo]( is an AI image generator that creates awesome, realistic images from simple text and image prompts.\n\nFeatures\n\n*   [Playground](/)\n*   [Upscaling](/)\n*   [Inpainting](/)\n*   [Outpainting](/)\n*   [Remove Background](/)\n*   [Hyper Realistic](/)\n*   [Pose Perfect](/)\n*   [Pose Copycat](/)\n\nCompany\n\n*   [Pricing]()\n*   [Roadmap]()\n*   [Testimonial]()\n*   [Become an Affiliate]()\n\nSupport\n\n*   [Contact Us]()\n*   [Faq]()\n*   [Privacy Policy]()\n*   [Term of Service]()\n\nResource\n\n*   [Doc]()\n*   [API Developer]() [Blog](/)\n\n2024 ¬© **GET BRANDSOME** - All rights reserved.\n\nv1.0.0\n\n[]( \"Our Facebook\")[](/ \"Our Instagram\")[](/ \"Our Linkedin\")[]( \"Our Twitter\")[]( \"Our Discord\")",

Using an automated crypto trading bot requires a basic understanding of current market trends and then matching a strategy to those trends. 3Commas offers a variety of proven templates created by professional users that can help new traders make well-performing crypto trading bots.\n    \n*   Bots trade crypto by automating the manual commands a user would normally make. They rely on triggers, referred to as signals, to tell them when to execute the buy and sell commands based on conditionals you select. Think of it as \"if X, then Y.\" These signals monitor the price movement of coins based on API connections with the crypto exchange, and then follow your commands when the market conditions are met. Multiple signals can be used to create complex trading strategies that are very difficult to execute manually. Common automated trading bots are DCA bots, Grid bots, Futures bots, Options bots, Arbitrage bots, and HODL bots.\n    \n*   Using a cryptocurrency trading bot is the best way to trade crypto if you plan on doing anything other than buying and holding. The bots never sleep and they can execute your strategy 24/7 so that you are not stuck at a computer inputting a lot of manual commands. Using a bitcoin trading bot, for example, allows you to automate buying the lows and selling the highs when the market is dynamic. Using bots to trade crypto allows you to have your assets working for you to seek opportunities and increase the value of your portfolio rather than sitting in storage.\n    \n*   This depends on several factors, such as the trading fees imposed by a supported brokerage such as Coinbase pro. Using an altcoin trading bot on a trading platform will typically require a monthly subscription fee between $14-50 depending on the number and type of bots you will be using. Trading fees on a crypto exchange are charged with each trade, which can make some high-frequency trading strategies unviable on exchanges with higher fees.\n    \n*   A trader can make considerable portfolio growth conducting bitcoin trading or altcoin trading if they're using the right strategies and settings. A proficient trader measures success by percentage earned from their average trades, rather than raw totals. It‚Äôs not uncommon for experienced traders to average between 15-25% in the green over the many crypto trades they do each week. New users will likely experience lower success¬† percentages as they learn more about how to do technical analysis of the market and how to fine-tune their bots to get better performance.\n    \n*   Automated trading has already been proven to work over the course of millions of bot trades. The key thing is to choose a reliable trading software that features cryptocurrency trading bots with proven track records. The software should also be very transparent with performance data so you have the information you need to create a solid trading strategy. Automated trading works well when users pair a bitcoin trading bot or altcoin trading bot with a good strategy and third party signals on a crypto exchange with reasonable fees.\n    \n    There are many market conditions where holding is not a good strategy. If the market is rapidly going down, a bot that sells your assets and then buys them back at a lower price can result in significant gains to your portfolio when the market recovers. When the market is flat, a Grid bot can take advantage of daily fluctuations to potentially grow your portfolio slowly over time rather than having your coins in cold storage doing nothing.\n    \n*   To set up a cryptocurrency trading bot, a trader needs to make a few decisions. First, which type of bot do you want to use? Then you need to pick which crypto exchange you want to use. Next, you need to decide which trading rules to configure the bot with. This includes the creation of a strategy that will determine how the bot trades, as well as choosing signals that determine when the bot trades. Alternatively, you can choose a preset template that has all of these trading rules locked in already, greatly simplifying the experience for the user.\n    \n*   Most crypto trading softwares offer a free option that includes 1-2 DCA or Grid bots. This is a low or no-cost way to learn the software, but most traders will want to upgrade to a paid plan that offers more bots so you can execute your trading strategies more effectively. Typically you can sign up for paid subscriptions using a credit card, debit card, or even pay with Bitcoin, Ethereum or some other stablecoin or altcoin.\n    \n*   There may be an issue with your payment method, in which case you should contact our support team for assistance.

This inclusivity opens up the art and design field to a broader audience, fostering diversity in creative expression.Experimentation with Diverse Styles: AI art tools offer the flexibility to explore a vast array of artistic styles‚Äîfrom classical to contemporary, from realistic portraits to surreal landscapes. This allows creators to experiment freely, blending different styles or creating entirely new ones without the constraints of traditional mediums.Enhanced Productivity: AI accelerates the art creation process, allowing artists to produce more work in less time. This increased productivity can be a significant advantage for commercial artists who need to meet tight deadlines or manage multiple projects simultaneously.Educational Tool: For educational purposes, AI art generators serve as excellent resources for learning about art techniques, historical styles, and the elements of visual composition. Educators can use these tools to provide students with hands-on experience in art creation, enhancing their understanding of aesthetic principles through practical application.Cost-Effectiveness: By using AI, artists and companies can reduce the costs associated with art production, such as materials, studio space, and even human resources.

This allows the AI to modify the speech output, making it sound more realistic and natural.\n*   The AI combines the phonetic components and language nuances to generate speech that closely mimics the natural human voice. The result is a smooth, natural-sounding audio output.\n\nHow can Murf help Content Creators with AI Voiceovers?¬†\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nCreating high-quality voiceovers not only consumed valuable time and resources but also often resulted in subpar audio quality despite the effort and expense.\n\nImagine if you could create studio-quality voiceovers from the comfort of your home without all the hassle and cost.\n\nWith Murf‚Äôs AI voice generator, you can do just that.

Businesses can use AI voice to enhance customer engagement, streamline content creation, and expand global reach with multilingual support, benefiting marketing, training, and customer service efforts.\n\n### Are content generated with AI voices copyrightable?\n\n![Image 20: Drop-down icon]()\n\nCopyright status of AI-generated content varies worldwide. In the United States for instance, it has been clarified that works created by a human author meet the requirement. This means that AI-generated content without any human creative input or intervention may not be eligible for copyright protection under current US law.\n\n### Can I use the AI voices for commercial purposes?\n\n![Image 21: Drop-down icon]()\n\nYes, you can use the content generated with Murf‚Äôs AI voices for commercial purposes. Murf provides commercial rights for the voiceovers, allowing you to use them in videos on YouTube or any other platform. As long as the text content you use is original and does not infringe on existing copyrights, you can monetize it without issues.\n\n### Is voice AI safe?\n\n![Image 22: Drop-down icon]()\n\nVoice AI is generally safe to use, but it does come with certain considerations and potential risks. While voice AI technologies enhance convenience, accessibility, and efficiency in many applications, there are concerns related to privacy, data security, and ethical use. Voice AI systems often require access to personal data and voice recordings, which can be vulnerable to hacking or misuse if not properly secured. Additionally, the potential for deepfake technology to create realistic but fraudulent audio can lead to misinformation and identity theft. To ensure safety, it is important to use reputable voice AI services that prioritize robust security measures, transparent data usage policies, and ethical guidelines. Murf is a great example of safe voice AI technology.\n\n### Is AI voice free?\n\n![Image 23: Drop-down icon]()\n\nAI voice services are not always free. Many providers offer a range of pricing models, from free tiers with limited features to premium subscriptions that provide more advanced capabilities and higher-quality outputs. The availability of free AI voices often comes with restrictions on usage, customization, and commercial rights.\n\nMurf AI, for example, offers both free and paid plans. The free plan typically provides access to basic features and a limited 10-minute voice generation time, which can be useful for small projects or personal use.

They also help automate customer service interactions, handling inquiries, and providing information efficiently.\n\n### What is the difference between human voice and AI voice?\n\n![Image 25: Drop-down icon]()\n\nAI generated voice sound monotonous and robotic, lacking human nuances and emotion. They are generated using sophisticated algorithms and neural networks trained on extensive datasets of human speech, resulting in consistent and customizable outputs. AI voices are ideal for applications requiring high volume and uniformity, such as virtual assistants and automated customer service, and can be produced on-demand at a lower cost.\n\nHuman voices, on the other hand, offer rich expressiveness and variability, making them more engaging and relatable, especially in contexts where emotional connection is crucial.

By removing the most explicit content from the training data, we minimized DALL¬∑E 2‚Äôs exposure to these concepts. We also used advanced techniques to prevent photorealistic generations of real individuals‚Äô faces, including those of public figures.  \n[Read about improving safety]()\n\n**Curbing misuse  \n**Our content policy does not allow users to generate violent, adult, or political content, among other categories.

We also have automated and human monitoring systems to guard against misuse.  \n[Read content policy(opens in a new window)]()\n\n**Phased deployment based on learning  \n**Learning from real-world use is an important part of developing and deploying AI responsibly. We began by previewing DALL¬∑E 2 to a limited number of trusted users. As we learned more about the technology‚Äôs capabilities and limitations, and gained confidence in our safety systems, we slowly added more users and made DALL¬∑E available in beta in July 2022.  \n[View risks and limitations(opens in a new window)]()\n\n#### Our hope is that DALL¬∑E 2 will empower people to express themselves creatively.

But unless you have a photographic memory, it can be really hard to remember all of the parameters and styling options the Midjourney bot supports! That's where this prompt helper comes in handy.\n\nStart by typing the main concept for your image. Then set any parameters (like [aspect ratio](/) to change your image dimensions, or [chaos](/) to increase variation) you'd like the Midjourney bot to follow. From there, you can apply some of our style presets and \"weight\" parts of your prompt (Midjourney will strongly follow a weighting of 5, and lightly consider a weighting of 1).\n\nOnce you've got your prompt dialed in, copy it to your clipboard and run it in Midjourney. Be sure to save it to your PromptFolder account so you can come back to it later!\n\n### What is Midjourney?\n\nMidjourney is an application that allows you to generate completely unique images through the power of artificial intelligence. It has absolutely exploded in popularity ([check out some interesting Midjourney statistics here](/)) and is one of the largest AI tools aside from [ChatGPT](/).\n\n##### Edit Prompt

I love it!\n\nIrian\n\n> This is so GOOD that it‚Äôs SCARY!\n\nRui Rei\n\n> I started a Github Copilot trial a couple months ago because I thought it was the only solution available, but then I found Codeium. It has an equivalent, if not more extensive, feature-set and is free. Win-win.\n\nAndrew Tibbetts\n\n> Great tool! I've installed in Visual Studio 2022 and in Visual Studio Code. It seems to understand my coding logic, and especially in Javascript, propose to me the code blocks that I'm going to write.\n\nBruno Migliaretti\n\n> Fantastic tool, I tried all the AI assistants I could find but this is by far the best. Quick to setup, easy to use, suggestions and written snippets relevant and a good basis to work with.\n\nErik Timmermans\n\n> I recently had the pleasure of using Codeium and I must say, it has completely transformed my coding experience. This app is a true gem for developers working in Python, Javascript, TypeScript, Java, Go, and beyond.\n\nDonny Rivera\n\n> Using Github Copilot these days. But I‚Äôve been more impressed with Codeium.\n\nSuzal SM\n\n@prameshbajra\n\n> I like how simple Codeium is and that it doesn‚Äôt get in the way of development. It has made it effortless to write high quality log messages, even with a custom print format and logging module.\n\nCameron Sinko\n\nSoftware Engineer, Andruil\n\n> Codeium is very feature rich, and every bit as complete as its leading competitor.\n\nJames Holt\n\n> Codeium acts as an intelligent autocomplete, a code explainer, and a quick code generator to get you started. As a solo developer I find it invaluable. It also doesn‚Äôt regurgitate GPL code which is legally reassuring.\n\nPaul Bristow\n\n> This is incredible. The code suggestion feature is my favorite part and improves my productivity significantly. I love it.\n\ngabor.deli\n\n> I've been using Codeium for about a month now. I now have experienced at least a 50% increase in efficiency.\n\nByran Fallin\n\nLead Network Tools Admin, C Spire\n\n> Great extension for VSCode! I use it daily to help with code suggestions and applying documentation to my functions. Very functional replacement for Copilot in my honest opinion.\n\nTyler Buell\n\n> Great tool and free for indiviual developers. I'm a senior developer of over 25 years and this is such a native part of my workflow now I'd be lost without it.\n\nAndy Jeffries\n\n> Outstanding! I thoroughly tested Copilot, Replit, Tabnine, Cody and CodeWhisperer and none of them match the performance, accuracy, and intuitive operation of Codeium. I simply could not be happier with it.\n\nAndy Gee\n\n> Codeium has an incredible awareness which continually surprises you. Since installing this for my team, we have been more efficient and productive. Really really useful, and highly recommended.\n\nDavid Moxon\n\n> Using Github Copilot these days.

Here‚Äôs what some of our satisfied users have to say:\n\n[1]()\n\n### Highly recommend!\n\nI have been testing and using Vestinda since the beginning of Private Beta and I adopted it. It makes me gain time in terms of programming and it is very easy to connect my strategy to my broker. Highly recommend!\n\n> **Sajid Lhessani**[AlgorithmicTradingbySajid]()\n\n### A complete product\n\nI discovered Vestinda just when I was thinking about writing my own tool for automating trades, and it turned out to be way above what I could have done by myself. From my point of view, it‚Äôs a complete product for someone who wants to trade without being always there.\n\n> **Stefan Popescu**Software Engineer\n\n### Vestinda is like no other platform in its field\n\nVestinda is easy to use, the possibilities are endless and you can easily start building effective automated trading systems. The team has thought of everything and Vestinda is like no other platform in its field.\n\n> **Faraz Hossein Khani**Algorithmic trading programmer\n\n### The perfect tool for beginner investors\n\nI tried out Vestinda, and I have to say it is soooo pretty looking and intuitive! All UI controls are absolutely clear for me. I created my first strategy and started backtesting in minutes, literally. Great! I think this might be the perfect tool for beginner investors.\n\n> **Alexander**Quant programmer\n\n### Using the platform didn‚Äôt put me under emotional pressure\n\nI started testing Vestinda following my collaboration with Alexandru Hobincu. At first, I was a bit skeptical, which is why I started with small amounts to convince myself of the platform‚Äôs performance. After 6 months of being active on Vestinda, the strategy has managed to generate approximately the same percentage profit as my personal trades. And unlike my personal trades, using the platform didn‚Äôt put me under emotional pressure.\n\n> **Bogdan Alexandru**\n\n### From our Blog\n\nRead the latest articles and crypto interviews\n\n[See all articles]()\n\n[![Image 32: How to create your own pensions' dashboard]( \"How to create your own pensions‚Äô dashboard\")\n\n### [How to create your own pensions‚Äô dashboard]( \"How to create your own pensions‚Äô dashboard\")\n\n[Investing]()\n\nCreating a personalized pensions dashboard‚Ä¶\n\n[Continue reading]()\n\nAugust 1, 2024\n\n 3456 6912 Ebiere Watchman  Ebiere Watchman2024-08-01 18:19:032024-08-01 18:19:03How to create your own pensions‚Äô dashboard\n\n[![Image 34: Best DeFi wallets to consider in 2024]( \"Best DeFi wallets to consider in 2024\")\n\n### [Best DeFi wallets to consider in 2024]( \"Best DeFi wallets to consider in 2024\")\n\n[Crypto](), [DeFi]()\n\nThe world of decentralized finance (DeFi)‚Ä¶\n\n[Continue reading]()\n\nAugust 1, 2024\n\n 3456 6912 Ebiere Watchman  Ebiere Watchman2024-08-01 17:17:272024-08-01 17:22:15Best DeFi wallets to consider in 2024\n\n[![Image 36: 7 beginner mistakes in crypto and how to avoid them]( \"7 beginner mistakes in crypto and how to avoid them\")\n\n### [7 beginner mistakes in crypto and how to avoid them]( \"7 beginner mistakes in crypto and how to avoid them\")\n\n[Crypto]()\n\nGiving into the crypto can be both thrilling.‚Ä¶\n\n[Continue reading]()\n\nAugust 1, 2024\n\n 3456 6912 Ebiere Watchman  Ebiere Watchman2024-08-01 15:42:062024-08-01 15:42:067 beginner mistakes in crypto and how to avoid them\n\n[![Image 38: How to create a crowdfunding platform for real estate]( \"How to create a crowdfunding platform for real estate\")\n\n### [How to create a crowdfunding platform for real estate]( \"How to create a crowdfunding platform for real estate\")\n\n[Investing]()\n\nHave you ever wondered how to tap into the lucrative‚Ä¶\n\n[Continue reading]()\n\nJuly 31, 2024\n\n 3456 6912 Ebiere Watchman  Ebiere Watchman2024-07-31 10:43:482024-07-31 10:43:48How to create a crowdfunding platform for real estate\n\n### Are you a Trading Leader?\n\nGrow with your community\n\n[Start earning]()\n\nFor your community\n\n#### Community benefits\n\nAccess to a practice hub that enables traders to try out various strategies\n\nWith more than 100 technical indicators and multiple tick intervals, traders can innovate and test their ideas with a powerful backtesting engine in just a few minutes.

It implements dozens of speed optimization techniques from simple minification to JS delay and critical CSS generation for frontend optimization and Cloudflare Enterprise CDN for an even faster performance and security. There is no need to run another speed optimization plugin along with 10Web.\n\n![Image 121: Down]() ![Image 122: Up]()\n\nHow does image optimization of 10Web Booster work?\n\nImage optimization does several things. First it converts images to WebP format, which drastically reduces the size of your website images, allowing them to quickly load.\n\nSecond, it implements container-specific image resizing, which creates small size images and displays them instead of full-size images for visitors using small-screen devices.\n\nThird, image optimization implements lazy-loading and preloading of images, two techniques ensuring fast webpage loading with instant on-demand image display.\n\nOn top of that, with Cloudflare‚Äôs Mirage optimization, we optimize all images based on device and network connection types for each mobile visitor\n\n![Image 123: Down]() ![Image 124: Up]()\n\nHow do I enable Cloudflare Enterprise on 10Web Booster?\n\nFrom your 10Web Booster dashboard sidebar, go to Cloudflare Enterprise and click ‚ÄòEnable‚Äô. After that, you‚Äôll be prompted to double check your original server IP, point your domain and configure DNS records as instructed. After your website is verified, Cloudflare Enterprise will show an ‚ÄòActive‚Äô status in the ‚ÄòOverview‚Äô tab of your dashboard.\n\n[![Image 125: 10Web logo](/ \"10web\")\n\nTenWeb, Inc.  \n40 E Main St, Suite 721  \nNewark, DE 19711  \nUnited States\n\n### Company![Image 126: arrow]()\n\n*   [About Us](/)\n*   [Contact Us](/)\n*   [Security Statement](/)\n*   [Affiliates](/)\n*   [Careers](/)\n*   [Pricing](/)\n\n### Product![Image 127: arrow]()\n\n*   [AI Website Builder](/)\n*   [AI Ecommerce](/)\n*   [Hosting]()\n*   [PageSpeed Booster](/)\n*   [AI Business Name Generator](/)\n*   [Industries](/)\n*   [AI Assistant](/)\n*   [AI Marketing Strategy Generator](/)\n*   [Plugins](/)\n*   [Widgets](/)\n*   [Website Management](/)\n\n### Customers![Image 128: arrow]()\n\n*   [10Web for Agencies & Freelancers](/)\n*   [Case Studies](/)\n*   [10Web for SMBs](/)\n*   [Customer Reviews](/)\n\n### Resources![Image 129: arrow]()\n\n*   [Help Center]()\n*   [Blog](/)\n*   [Website Builder Comparisons]()\n*   [Hosting Comparisons]()\n*   [AI Simplified Newsletter](/)\n*   [Plugin Repository](/)\n*   [WordPress Glossary](/)\n*   [WooCommerce Glossary](/)\n*   [Hosting Glossary](/)\n*   [Site Speed Glossary](/)\n*   [Hosting Solutions](/)\n*   [Press Kit](/)\n*   [Roadmap]()\n*   [Submit Your Idea]()\n*   [Facebook Community](/)\n*   [AI Technology](/)\n*   [System Status](/)\n\n*   [![Image 130: Slack]()\n*   [![Image 131: Twitter]()\n*   [![Image 132: Youtube]()\n*   [![Image 133: Facebook](/)\n*   [![Image 134: Linkedin](/)\n\nCopyright ¬© 2024 TenWeb.

Highly recommend that EVERYONE give this a try and see how far AI has come!\n\n![Image 195]()\n\nAlex Hylton\n\nEntrepreneur\n\nSmartwriter is incredible copy, period.

Increase your open and response rates by multiples. Brilliant developers and roadmap is very promising. This is the real deal. If you have an opportunity. Don't wait, incorporate SmartWriter into your stack TODAY! This is one of my best MarTech investments in 2021!\n\n![Image 208]()\n\nDamon Malkiewicz\n\nSmartWriter is the first AI content tool I've seen that breaks the mold. Rather than being another \"me too\" product that does a little bit of everything, it hones in on cold outreach. They've developed models I've seen nowhere else - and they work quite well. On top of that, its founder, Vaibhav Namburi, is passionate about his product and actively releasing innovative updates. If you haven't check this out, I highly recommended it!\n\n![Image 209]()\n\nMarcus Wong\n\nKinda busy atm, will get back to this.\n\nI feel it's always a little tricky trying to automate cold outreach ‚Äî results are usually really poor since there's a lack of personalisation. But, using SmartWriter in my process helps allay this problem and make my emails sound more genuine. Although I'll never stop with the manual way of researching and reaching out to someone, I can see how SmartWriter can reduce many missed opportunities by using this tool on a larger amount of contacts that I will never have the time to handle myself manually. I would recommend anyone to give this a try if you're exploring the idea of automated outreach.\n\n![Image 210]()\n\nNishanth A\n\nCurious\n\nI was convinced the outputs of these intro line generator apps would suck after trying a couple of them initially and didn't bother with Smartwriter initially, but I was pleasantly surprised at how SmartWriter has performed and with the new improvements on a weekly basis, this is turning into a very solid tool.\n\n![Image 211]()\n\nSavian BoroancƒÉ\n\nCommunity Builder\n\nI‚Äôll use it for my day to day business. It‚Äôs a great idea and a powerful product. Keep up the good work! üëè\n\n![Image 212]()\n\nGuru Muscle\n\nIt's great tool. Especially a copy for cold emails. That was the main reason we have purchased it. Wish them all the best and grow to the moon :)\n\n![Image 213]()\n\nMarcell\n\nLove smartwriter! Its extremely simple to use.

Love the ease of use and the extensive number of features available to expand content and do outreach.\n\n![Image 216]()\n\nPhilip Home\n\nI hope my competitors don't discover SmartWriter! Game changer for organisations that utilise outreach. 10/10 for the product, team and leadership. Kudos for a really smart application of Ai tech.\n\n![Image 217]()\n\nJonathan Baillie Strong\n\nCommunity builder, podcasting geek\n\nHaving used a couple of AI writing tools, Smartwriter stands out with some particularly advanced templates - Instagram replies, quora replies and personalized outreach for example. The video documentation for the new features is also extremely well done.\n\n![Image 218]()\n\nRon Beaubien\n\nI'm an online marketer.\n\nI have been using SmartWriter for the last two months or so. I now use SmartWriter exclusively to personalize cold outreach. It has saved me countless hours during the laborious task of researching and writing. Within hours of leaving feedback on the product, I not only received a reply from Vaibhav Nanburi but the software was also immediately updated resolving the problem I had raised. I have been nothing but impressed by SmartWriter for cold outreach and have been using almost daily.\n\n![Image 219]()\n\nJM&Co. Recruitment\n\nRecruitment Professionals\n\nIf you are looking for a way to dominate marketing, email generation and social posts, then SmartWriter.ai is a tool you need to have in your briefcase! I thought that I would test SmartWriter.ai out by creating a sales email for a prospect client that has been difficult to connect with. What SmartWriter.ai collated for me was just genius, and the narrative / tone of voice was so in tune with our brand... it blew me away and I have now created this content as a template for all of our outreach emails! So, in conclusion... it‚Äôs easy to use and set up, it has powerful automation tools, and it saves time so you can get back to focusing on what‚Äôs important ‚Äì running your business. In my opinion, SmartWriter.ai is the perfect marketing tool for all levels of expertise and works seamlessly with your existing marketing strategies.

All custom avatars can be used in AI Studios.\n\n### Can I edit AI-generate videos in AI Studios?\n\nAI Studios lets you create and edit videos with AI in one convenient platform.

The more keywords you rank for, the more traffic you get ‚Äî and more traffic equals more money.\n\nYou think anyone makes a good living from SEO only owning one website? Not a chance. They'll own dozens, maybe hundreds. And every one of those websites needs content... and needs it regularly.\n\n**This is a fact:** If you're limited by the amount of content you can produce, you and your business are being held back. If you can't produce serious amounts of content regularly, you'll NEVER get the traffic.\n\nYou need almost unlimited high-quality content... that has absolutely **ZERO** footprint of being generated with AI.\n\nNow, some people get around this issue by hiring teams of writers.  \n**But what if you don't have a trust fund to play with?**\n\nThen You Use Article Rewriters...  \nBut They Come With Their  \nOwn Set Of Problems\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* * *\n\nWhere people go wrong with SEO is thinking that any content will do.\n\nBut if that was true, we'd just let the cat walk over the keyboard and call it a day.\n\nWhat you need is QUALITY. Google is looking for GOOD content ‚Äî and if you don't have it, at best you just won't get good rankings.\n\nAt worst, you're getting thrown out of Google and deindexed.\n\nAnd most rewriters just can't deliver the quality you need.\n\nYou've probably seen what other article spinners put out. It reads like someone gave a thesaurus to a hyperactive two-year-old.\n\nAnd if you use ChatGPT, all of your content will have that unmistakable \"smell\" of AI. You know how it always ends articles with \"ü§ñ in conclusion\" ‚Äî and Google knows it, too.\n\nSo How Is It Possible To  \nGet Results Like This?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n![Image 10: Spin Rewriter - Search engine traffic from 0 to 139,000 visitors in under 3 months]()\n\nMy free traffic from search engines went from 0 to 139,000 visitors in under 3 months!\n\n### That was on a brand-new website.  \nNow, here's a website that I've had for years:\n\n![Image 11: Spin Rewriter - 1,174,229 organic visitors per month]()\n\nActual screenshot from my Analytics account: 1,174,229 free visitors per month!\n\nWith Spin Rewriter AI, You Can Generate  \nHundreds of Human-Quality Articles  \nIn Minutes...\n\nWhy? Because We've Got  \nTWO (2) Secret Weapons  \nNo Other Rewriter Has\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* * *\n\nFirst of all:\n\nThe problem is, most spinners don't understand language the way you do.\n\nWhat they produce reads like something you'd get from a 2-year-old with a thesaurus precisely because they WORK like a 2-year-old with a thesaurus.\n\nThey don't understand that a word can have more than one meaning.\n\nSo they don't get that \"book\" can mean both \"a novel\" and \"make a reservation\". Which is why the articles they produce don't make any sense.\n\nSpin Rewriter Delivers An Entirely  \nNew Level of Language Understanding\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* * *\n\nSpin Rewriter AI is using the latest-and-greatest Large Language Model (LLM) technology.\n\nIt looks at the whole article. It doesn't just look up words ‚Äî it analyzes the entire text to understand its exact meaning.\n\nAnd this means that Spin Rewriter understands what your articles are trying to say ‚Äî and it can rewrite your articles _truly_ intelligently.\n\nThis approach is built on top of Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nThat's the exact same technology ChatGPT is using to create its content... and that Google is now using to rank the quality of content on the web.\n\nBut Spin Rewriter AI Takes Things  \nOne Hugely Important Step Further\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* * *\n\nYou see, we have placed our own in-house technology on top of the LLM.\n\nWe're talking about an AI model that we have developed in-hous. An advanced AI model that we have fine-tuned to deliver the best possible results specifically in SEO.\n\nWe're calling this layer-of-goodness the Emulated Natural Language (ENL).\n\nAnd it's how Spin Rewriter AI can deliver hundreds of human-quality articles ‚Äî with absolutely zero AI-footprint.\n\nIt's how we deliver top-quality content that _ranks on Google_ like a boss. üòé\n\n* * *\n\nSo What's The Difference Between  \nEmulated Natural Language Rewriting  \nAnd Regular Rewriting?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* * *\n\nWell, we could talk about algorithms and machine learning and all  \nthat boring stuff. But it's better just to show you:\n\nOriginal text:\n\nJohn can relax and read a book, because his kids  \ncan book the vacation for him.\n\nRewritten text by other article spinners:\n\nRewritten text by Spin Rewriter AI with ENL:\n\nJohn can is able to relax  \nand read a book novel,  \nbecause his kids can is able to  \nbook novel the vacation for him.\n\nJohn can is able to relax  \nand read a book novel,  \nbecause his kids can are able to  \nbook make a reservation for the vacation for him.\n\nSpin Rewriter understands that \"book\" can have two different meanings and picks the right one. It also understands that \"can\" represents either \"is able to\" or \"are able to\", entirely depending on its context.\n\nThis way you don't end up with \"his kids is able to novel the vacation for him\".\n\nMake No Mistake,  \nTHIS Is How Your Rewriter Should Work.\n\nAnd It's Why  \nSpin Rewriter AI is the Market Leader:\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n![Image 12: Mike Mallery]()\n\n‚ÄúSpin Rewriter has saved me hundreds, if not thousands of hours.

This recent AI breakthrough in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had our entire team going absolutely crazy since the very beginning.\n\nThis has truly been the stuff of dreams for people like us who have devoted our lives and careers to processing natural language through algorithms. Our very own ENL (Emulated Natural Language) Semantic Rewriting is taking such a giant leap forward that you might find it hard to believe. And we absolutely could not be more excited to deliver this!\n\nüî• ¬† Paragraph-Level Rewriting: We are now using cutting-edge LLM AI that rewrites articles on the level of individual paragraphs in ways we couldn't possibly imagine even a mere five years ago. This new feature feels absolutely magical. Oh, and it literally guarantees 100% uniqueness and human-like readability of your generated articles!\n\nüî• ¬† SEO Content Co-Pilot: This brand-new tool makes it an absolute breeze to generate top-notch metadata for each of your generated article. This tool will fully optimize the titles of your articles, auto-generate descriptions, keywords, WordPress tags, ... while carefully considering every aspect of the SEO performance of your generated articles.\n\nüî• ¬† Text Humanizer: **This is a HUGE one.** The brand new Text Humanizer now takes just a single click to \"humanize\" each of your generated articles to be absolutely undetectable as machine-generated content. We're delivering this feature by using an additional LLM AI that's been fine-tuned on top-quality SEO content for best results. This technology also introduces tiny little human imperfections into your articles to make them seem even more genuine. With Text Humanizer, your generated articles will now be completely indistinguishable from human-written articles.\n\nüî• ¬† Built-In Translator: Spin Rewriter AI makes it extremely easy to translate each of your generated articles into any one of 30+ languages with just two clicks ‚Äî and you're done in seconds.\n\nüî• ¬† Text Localizer: Another revolutionary feature that Spin Rewriter AI is the first to bring to market. If you're targeting a particular English-speaking market like the UK or Australia, this innovative feature will automatically fine-tune your content in terms of regionalisms (spellings, common phrases, etc.) so that it feels 100% familiar to your target audience.

I have tried all of the spinners out there and nothing compares to Spin Rewriter! It is by far the easiest to use, most powerful spinner that provides the best results on the market.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî Kevin Hauff ![Image 43: 5-star rating]() ![Image 44: Verified buyer]() Verified Buyer\n\nVirtually every big-name SEO tool integrates the Spin Rewriter API.\n\nYou can use Spin Rewriter with all of these tools, and dozens of others. Simply plug in your Spin Rewriter account and you'll bring the power of ENL Semantic Rewriting straight into these apps:\n\n![Image 45: Spin Rewriter - Logos of Integration Partners]() ![Image 46: Spin Rewriter - Logos of Integration Partners]()\n\nAnd On Top Of All That, You're Getting  \nOne Of The Biggest Feature Sets  \nOf ANY Content Rewriter Today\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* * *\n\nSide-by-side comparison of original and spun text\n\nDirectly compare your original and new spun articles so you can immediately see the difference. This makes it incredibly easy to see at a glance how unique your new text is.\n\nStock photo integration\n\nAdd relevant public domain images to your articles ‚Äî just select which ones you want, and Spin Rewriter will automatically add a relevant selection between paragraphs.\n\nDeep rewriting\n\nThis massively multiplies the number of variations you can get from just a single article ‚Äî meaning that with Spin Rewriter, every article goes much further.\n\nSentence and paragraph-level rewriting\n\nSpin Rewriter understands phrases, sentences and even whole paragraphs. This gives you results that are more unique, and STILL read better thanks to the ENL Semantic Rewriting technology.\n\nHTML formatting\n\nBy default, Spin Rewriter is set up to provide content that's ready to be cut-and-pasted into WordPress blogs. And if you want HTML, just flick the switch and you'll get a fully marked-up version ready to go.\n\nAll popular spintax styles supported\n\nWe want to make sure you can use your Spin Rewriter articles with every other system out there. That's why we support all 5 of the most popular spintax styles. Just choose the one you want to use and push the button.\n\nWorks on all devices\n\nSpin Rewriter lives in the cloud which means it will adapt to every device you have. Desktops, laptops, tablets, phones... Spin Rewriter feels right at home on all of them.\n\nCollection of detailed video tutorials\n\nWe want to make it easy for you to use Spin Rewriter to its fullest potential. That's why we have prepared a collection of more than 10 detailed video tutorials. Armed with these tutorials, your spin-fu will be a thing to behold.\n\nParagraph creation\n\nStop rewording. Start creating.  \nSpin Rewriter can find additional information in your existing paragraphs and create entirely new content on its own. With completely new paragraphs, your original article is masked even further ‚Äî giving you content that would pass even a side-by-side comparison.\n\nList shuffle\n\nSmart list shuffling detects unordered lists and puts the elements in a completely new order, increasing the uniqueness of your articles. But don't worry ‚Äî it won't touch your numbered lists. You won't find a 2, 5, 8, 3, 4 list on Spin Rewriter's watch.\n\nIgnore original words\n\nCreate something completely new. You can set Spin Rewriter to only use alternative synonyms when creating a new version of your article, and NONE of the original words will make it in. This is EXTREME rewriting ‚Äî and it's how you guarantee total uniqueness.\n\nCopyscape integration\n\nConnect your Copyscape account and get instant proof whether your article passes the uniqueness test.  \n(Spoiler alert: It will. Every time.)\n\nGrammar and spell-checker\n\nIf you start with an article that's riddled with grammar errors, your rewriting is never going to work well. Which means you end up spending those extra hours fixing not one, but 500 versions! Spin Rewriter's grammar checker makes sure that your articles would pass any English test, even if you don't know (or care) what a third-person past-participle is.\n\nWord and character count\n\nMaking sure that you've got a range of different lengths of articles on your websites removes an obvious red flag for Google. Spin Rewriter gives you word and character counts for every created spun article, so you can make sure you've got the variety that'll make your websites look perfectly natural.\n\nParallel processing\n\nWe're constantly improving our algorithms to make the best possible use of resources ‚Äî and for non-geeks, this means you'll not only be able to spin all kinds of complicated articles in seconds, but the rewriting process is also getting faster all the time.\n\nMass export\n\nGenerate up to 1,000 variations of your article at once.  \nThis means with just one button-press, you can create enough content to fill your blogs, your satellite sites, even your entire PBN.\n\nSave for later\n\nSometimes life happens.  \nEven when you need to take a break while in the middle of a project, Spin Rewriter will save all your work and make sure nothing is lost. Even automatically.\n\nManual and automated rewriting\n\nWant to create your own spintax? Not a problem.  \nWant Spin Rewriter to do it all for you? Even easier. Hit the button and the algorithm will automatically spin the whole thing for you.\n\nBulk article rewriting\n\nGot more than one article you need to rewrite?  \nSpin Rewriter can handle all of them at once, giving you the ability to create virtually unlimited content instantly.\n\nBetter Yet...  \nWatch (Hands-On!)  \nWhat Spin Rewriter AI Can Do:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis Is 12 Years' Worth Of Features...  \nAnd You Get To Try Everything Out  \nFor FREE !\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* * *\n\nThat's not a typo.\n\nYou can get full access to Spin Rewriter AI ‚Äî completely unlimited, with all of the features included ‚Äî for the sum total of $0.00.\n\nHere's the thing.

What I like is that you can be very specific with this writer (tell it to make an article, an introduction, highlight why something is good, etc...) I think there are over 100 commands to tell how to write something. Of the 30 I have tried maybe 5 are useful for me but still you don't need many to write a long article. Incredibly solid new addition for my team.\n    \n\n*   Caroline\n    \n    I am so impressed with this software! At first, I had wondered if it was really going to generate any good headlines or copy in general but once I started using it I was blown away ‚Äì instant sell! It not only gives you great copy but sparks new ideas as well as helps you better shape your current ideas into more catchy ones. It is worth every penny!\n    \n*   Creative330\n    \n    Typli gives me the most naturally conversational/engaging style of writing i've come across in any of the AI writing tools. I don't know what it is about it but it's very good! It will most often impress me with this really nice natural sounding blog intro that leaves me wanting to keep reading!\n    \n*   Mike Rosales\n    \n    There is also a lot of thought in how you‚Äôd want to make your content in your website or blog, so it can be more eye-catching and memorable to your visitors. Typli.ai is writing high-quality copy for SEO. Pretty cool huh? I'm not a writer by profession but I do write a lot of \"documents\" at work. I am pretty sure that this will replace people‚Äôs work in coming years as copy is written by AI.\n    \n*   soufiane97\n    \n    Great App right at your finger tips. I am blown away by what Typli can do for my content in a tiny fraction of the time that I used to spend figuring what to write on my own! It's super easy to learn and create creative content for any website blog or product description!\n    \n*   tsdi.23a\n    \n    Ridiculously accurate and easy to use! The product is just great. It is very easy to use and delivers high-quality copy, it has amazing seo features that not every AI tool has. I'm interested to see how the credit system will go as far as pricing, but I believe I'll be able to get done what I need within the monthly allocation.\n    \n*   Leena\n    \n    All other AI writing apps I've used were too difficult for me. Typli.AI was the only one that proved to be useful. He helped me with my sentences and when it came to words that weren't in my vocabulary, he quickly responded with an alternate word.\n    \n*   anassmouatik\n    \n    The finished product is fantastic. It's simple to use and produces high-quality content, plus it offers SEO functions that not all AI tools have. I feel I'll be able to complete my tasks within the monthly budget.\n    \n*   Jeremy Burt\n    \n    you have a great offer, thanks so much. compared with the other options in the ai writing software, typli.ai with unlimited usage stands apart from the crowd. very powerful in terms of what you get and getting as much as you need. highly recommended. 5 crunchy tacos\n    \n*   YOUNESEL\n    \n    It does the work seamlessly. I tried other AS tools but I believe typli is generous in terms of output and features.\n    \n*   Med\n    \n    My overall experience with Typli has been great. TLDR: The customer service is outstanding, and I am so happy with the product. I am a one-person company. That means there is no one else to help with copywriting. Typli has added another member to my business. An excellent output that makes sense, and I am still perplexed how the AI can masterfully write fantastic copy.\n    \n*   Karen\n    \n    This tool can provide very convincing copy for a wide range of areas and uses. I was torn between Writesonic and Typli.AI, after trying both out I decided to go for Typli.AI and so far so good! Great tool and price, worth adding to your collection!\n    \n*   A satisfied customer\n    \n    I might not be a SEO professional, that's why I am using typli to generate some amazing text for my 9yo son. That gives him the opportunity to get wider ideas on a specific topic. It needs only few key words, that's it!\n    \n*   BLM007\n    \n    This tool is so smart, it makes my brain hurt! Seriously though, this program has made my copywriting skills x10 better. When you use this tool, you will be amazed at how well it understands what you are trying to communicate and delivers \"just-right\" written content that is grammatically correct and perfectly conveys your message. This is truly a ground-breaking product and I think all copywriters should have access to it.

Complete removal of your account and data is available upon request.\n\n[What Languages Does the AI Detector Work For? ![Image 76](#)\n\nOriginality.ai‚Äôs AI detection is currently only trained and tested against English language. Plagiarism checking works across multiple languages.\n\n[Can Originality.ai Detect Chat GPT Content? ![Image 77](#)\n\nYes, Originality.ai can detect ChatGPT content.\n\n[Can Google Detect and Penalize AI Generated Content? ![Image 78](#)\n\nWe completed a [correlation study](/) of 20,000 web pages and identified a small correlation between Originality score and Google search result ranking. Potentially indicating that AI content performs worse in Google than Original content.\n\n![Image 79]()\n\nGoogle has said that the appropriate use of AI to make content more useful is not against their guidelines.\n\nHowever, they have cotninued to be clear that the use of AI in an effort to game search results is against their guidelines. ‚ÄúUsing automation‚Äîincluding AI‚Äîto generate content with the primary purpose of manipulating ranking in search results is a [violation of our spam policies]().‚Äù [)\n\nOr worded another way from John Mueller‚Ä¶\n\n![Image 80]()\n\n[)\n\nAt Originality.ai we are not against AI content but believe that the decision to accept the Google risk of publishing AI generated content should be the decision of the website owner and not the writer.\n\n[Do Credits Expire? ![Image 81](#)\n\nYes, per our [Terms and Conditions](/) credits expire in 2 years from the date of purchase.\n\n[Do you Have a Plagiarism Checking and AI Detection API? ![Image 82](#)\n\nYes, we have a robust API and have integrated it into the content operations platforms for some of the largest publishers / writing agencies and marketplaces in the world.\n\nFull documentation is in the backend. If you have a unique use case or are wondering about capabilities to handle your volume please reach out and we will be happy to discuss your needs.\n\n[How Does AI Detection Work? ![Image 83](#)\n\nOur internally built artificial intelligence uses supervised learning with multiple models including a modified BERT model to predict if content is AI or Original. Our AI has been provided with millions of records both AI and Original content then trained to tell the difference between the two. After each training session a large test data set is used to evaluate if the new model is an improvement or not.\n\n[What Do AI Detection Scores Mean? ![Image 84](#)\n\nAI detection scores are a prediction on the chance that the text submitted was AI generated or Original. They are not a measure on the amount of AI vs amount of Original content in a given text.\n\nWe recommend not applying a similar ‚Äúhard‚Äù rule when it comes to working with AI scores and writers. If a writer consistently has high Originality scores but then on one article has a higher AI score, this could very likely be a false positive and further investigation should occur.\n\n‚Äç[Here](/) is our guidance on how to interpret the AI scores for writers.\n\n[Does Originality.ai Provide Paraphrase Detection? ![Image 85](#)\n\nYes, Originality.ai‚Äôs AI is the only available AI that has been trained to detect if content has been paraphrased with a tool like Quillbot. If a piece of text, regardless of whether it started as AI or Human, is run through a paraphrasing tool like Quillbot Originality.ai will identify the content as AI generated 95% of the time.\n\nRead more about [Paraphrase Plagiarism Checker](/)\n\nSee a quick live test: [)\n\nThe image below shows the detection accuracy for our Paraphrase Checker:\n\n![Image 86]()\n\n[What Can Cause False Positives? ![Image 87](#)\n\nFalse positives in AI detection do occur and we are sorry if Originality.ai identified your content as AI. It is different for every tool and a specific reason on what the AI identified as causing it to predict the con\n\nHere are 7 tips for minimizing false positives‚Ä¶\n\n1.  A detection score of 60% Original and 40% AI is not a false positive. It correctly predicted with 60% confidence that your content was Original. The [meaning of the score](/) is not that 60% was Original and 40% was AI it means it is 60% confident the content is Original.\n2.  Editing AI-written content is not a false positive - it is a true positive\n3.  Having AI edit your work is not a false positive - it is a true positive\n4.  When any amount of AI touches the content it can cause the entire article to be flagged as AI\n5.  ‚ÄúCyborg‚Äù writing where a lot of AI tools are used to create an outline, suggest edits, optimize the content can increase the chance of a higher AI score.¬†(For this reason we created a [free content optimizer](/) tool similar to SurferSEO or MarketMuse but 100% free that does not use AI to reduce the chance of a false positive occurring.)\n6.  Strange formatting can reduce the accuracy of the detector tools causing an increase in false positives or false negatives.¬†\n7.  The shorter the text the less accurate the detection score. We recommend at least 100 words being checked.¬†\n\nWe apologize if our tool has incorrectly identified your writing as AI!\n\n[What do you do if you have been falsely accused of using AI? ![Image 88](#)\n\n*   **See our in depth guide on avoiding and managing** [**AI detector false positives**]()¬†\n*   **Students** - Make sure your teacher is educated on the current [AI detection accuracy](/). Provide any details you have on the creation process. Using a Google Document and providing a screen recording. An AI detection score alone should not be used for academic integrity discipline.¬†\n*   **Writers** - Create your content in a Google Document and share the free Originality.ai chrome extension with your clients so that if there is any False Positive you can prove you created the document. Share how we recommend people [use the AI detection score](/). AI detection is not the same as plagiarism checking and should have a more nuanced approach to what is and is not acceptable.¬†¬†¬†¬†\n*   **Agencies** - The first thing any content agency needs to be doing is to define if it is acceptable for writers to use AI and if it is not then develop a process for checking. If you are choosing to use AI in producing content then make sure to communicate that transparently with clients. If you have clients that have accused your agency of having content produced by AI rather than human than refer to your company's policy/procedure for checking work and show the scan history of the writers work.¬†\n\n[False Positives - What Do I Do If I Have Been Falsely Accused of Using AI? ![Image 89](#)\n\nA false positive is when human-written content is identified as AI-written text by an AI detector. False positives do occur and can cause a lot of pain. Across hundreds of thousands of tests we currently see false positives occurring about 2% of the time that human work is submitted.\n\n2% false positives, despite being the lowest in the industry based on [our accuracy test](/), is too high.\n\nThe AI researchers and machine learning engineers at Originality are working constantly to both improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives.\n\nWe are heavily focused on equipping writers with tools to help them prove their contents Originality.\n\nIt was for the purpose of helping writers prove that their work was original that we developed a free Chrome Extension that allows anyone to visualise the creation process of a Google **Document**\n\n[Free AI Detection Chrome Extension](/)\n\n![Image 90]()\n\n[How Does Originality.ai Compare to Other AI Content Detectors? ![Image 91](#)\n\nOriginality.ai is the most accurate AI content detector producing the fewest false positives while also the only tool that accurately identifies a piece of content (human or AI) that has been paraphrased.\n\nSee the complete study analyzing how Originality.ai matches up in detection capabilities to other AI detectors here - [See Case Study](/).\n\nThe image below shows the results of a test of 1200 text samples, 600 AI generated and 600 human generated tested across multiple AI detectors:\n\n![Image 92]()\n\nThe table below shows the features Originality.ai has including‚Ä¶\n\n*   AI Detection\n*   Plagiarism Checking\n*   Paraphrase Detection (only tool to offer this)\n\n![Image 93]()\n\nOriginality.ai is more than an AI detector.

Each prediction our AI makes on a test data set is grouped into one of four buckets‚Ä¶\n\n*   True Positive - AI detector **correctly** identified AI content as AI\n*   False Negative - AI detector **incorrectly** identified AI content as Human\n*   False Positive - AI detector **incorrectly** identified Human content as AI\n*   True Negative - AI detector **correctly** identified Human content as Human\n\nThe image below shows the confusion matrix for Originality tested on GPT-4 generated content.\n\n![Image 95]()\n\n[What is AI Generated Text? ![Image 96](#)\n\nAI-generated text is words that have been written by Artificial Intelligence (AI) specifically using Large Language Models (LLMs). The most common example is OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT which is an AI using [OpenAI‚Äôs NLP Models](/) (GPT-3, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) to understand a users prompt and provide a written response.\n\nFor the purposes of AI text detection we aim to flag any content that has been meaningfully changed by AI.

But we have a fair use policy that prohibits certain usage patterns like the misuse of bots. When operating in WordHero Enhanced Mode, the limits are governed by the number of tokens available in your subscription plan. While 1000 tokens roughly equate to 750 words, both user's inputs and outputs will consume tokens.\n\nWhat technology does WordHero use?\n\n![Image 40: Chevron Icon]()\n\nWordHero is powered by the state-of-the-art language models GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. These advanced artificial intelligence technologies have been trained with 175 billion parameters, which enable the tool to understand prompts and generate human-like text, offering high-quality content writing services. WordHero also use proprietary AI technology.\n\nWill the prices change?\n\n![Image 41: Chevron Icon]()\n\nThe above are introductory prices and they will go up soon. However, once you subscribe to a plan, you're locked into the same price forever, until you unsubscribe.\n\nIs there a built-in plagiarism checker?\n\n![Image 42: Chevron Icon]()\n\nWe don‚Äôt have a built-in checker at this time. Plagiarism is generally not an issue as the AI is based on a generative language model, and does not lift content from online sources.\n\nCan I switch between yearly and monthly plans after I sign up?\n\n![Image 43: Chevron Icon]()\n\nYes, you can switch plans after your current billing period ends. And it will be done at the prevailing rates.\n\nDoes WordHero completely replace the need for writers?\n\n![Image 44: Chevron Icon]()\n\nWhile WordHero‚Äôs AI technology is as advanced as it has ever been, it still does not replace writers. A human is still required to edit the outputs.\n\nWhat's the difference between the lifetime and monthly/annual subscriptions\n\n![Image 45: Chevron Icon]()\n\nThe main difference between our lifetime pro and monthly/annual subscriptions lies in resource allocation. Monthly/yearly plans offer much higher limits for WordHero Enhanced Mode tokens, WordHero Art credits and team members, making them ideal for frequent use. Lifetime pro subscription offers value for users who do not require these resources extensively, while still providing unlimited content generation and access to all tools.\n\nWhere can I find out more about WordHero features such as Enhanced Mode and to view demos?\n\n![Image 46: Chevron Icon]()\n\nFor detailed information on WordHero features like Enhanced Mode, visit our [Features]() page. Additionally, subscribe to our [WordHero YouTube Channel]() for regular updates, informative videos and features or tools demos.\n\nAm I able to add more resources, such as Enhanced Mode tokens or Art credits, or to add more users?\n\n![Image 47: Chevron Icon]()\n\nYes you can.

[It can create articles, blog posts, and even essays on a variety of topics](). Botowski is designed to be user-friendly; all you need to do is input a topic, and it will take care of the rest.\n\nOne advantage of using Botowski is that you can be sure your content will be original. The program uses artificial intelligence to come up with ideas and then create polished pieces of writing based on those ideas. This means that you don‚Äôt have to worry about plagiarism or copycat content.\n\nAnother benefit of Botowski is that it‚Äôs fast.

The generator can be used for a variety of purposes, such as creating new articles, generating product descriptions, or even writing poetry. There are many different types of AI content generators, but most work in a similar way. The program takes data from sources such as articles, websites, or social media posts and then analyzes it to find patterns. It then uses these patterns to create its own content that is similar to the original material.\n\nSome of the most popular AI content generators are based on GPT-3. Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a neural network model that has been shown to be very effective in natural language processing (NLP). It is based on the [Transformer](/)) architecture. The key advantage of GPT-3 over other NLP models is its ability to learn representations of text without the need for extensive training data. This makes it particularly well suited for use in applications such as machine translation, where large amounts of training data are not always available.\n\n### Is Botowski really free?\n\nThe answer is yes! Botowski offers a free account option that allows users to do pretty much anything without upgrading, and also provides daily credits so that anyone can use it for free without spending a dime - ever!\n\n### Instructions on how to use Botowski\n\nBotowski is easy peasy to use - just enter a few words and hit Generate! You can also pick a tone for your output, whether you need it to sound professional, witty, or scientific. So why wait? Give Botowski a try today!\n\n### Why it's a good option compared to other content generators?\n\nThere are a number of reasons why Botowski is a good option compared to other AI content generators. First and foremost, it's free, unlike many other options that limit users on every step. Second, the output is very high quality - Botowski has been known to produce essays that are indistinguishable from those written by humans. Third, support is awesome - help is always available when you need it, and the team responds quickly to queries. Finally, Botowski is not feature heavy - it's simple to use and doesn't require any special knowledge or expertise.\n\n### Who can use it?\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the use will vary depending on the needs of the user. However, in general, AI content generators can be used by anyone who wants to create high-quality content quickly and easily. This includes businesses, bloggers, students, and professionals of all kinds.\n\nBusinesses can use AI content generators to create marketing materials, website copy, and other types of content. Bloggers can use them to create blog posts, articles, and other content. Students can use them to write essays and papers. And professionals can use them to produce presentations, reports, and other documents.\n\n### Who owns the created content?\n\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) technology continues to evolve, so does the potential for its use in content creation. With AI-generated content, businesses and individuals now have the ability to create high-quality, unique content quickly and easily. However, who owns this content? You do!\n\nWhen it comes to AI-generated content, you are the owner and copyright holder of the work. The AI software is simply a tool that you use to create the content ‚Äì much like a word processor or a graphic design program. This means that you have full control over how the content is used and can choose to share it or not as you see fit.\n\n  \n  \nFree trial\n\nPut your content creation on autopilot with AI\n----------------------------------------------\n\nTry our service for free.

After using it for a few days, I‚Äôve installed it on all my major blogs. Though I‚Äôve initially installed it as an internal linking plugin, I discovered so many useful features later. It saves a lot of time and energy. I really appreciate the team for this fantastic plugin.\n    \n*   ![Image 43]()\n    \n    > Link Whisper has helped us improve the experience for our readers looking for related articles on Wealthtender while improving our SEO. This plugin saves me countless hours and I continue to be impressed when new features are rolled out. If you have more than a couple dozen articles on your website, I highly recommend adding Link Whisper to your site right away.\n    \n*   ![Image 44]()\n    \n    > When we purchased hittingthegolfball.com the internal linking was a mess. There was no structure to any of the posts and link juice was running down the drain. With Link Whisper it took us an afternoon to get everything to where it should be. This would have been many days of work or at least many hours managing a VA to do the same thing. Furthermore, it‚Äôs the easiest 5-minute job to add internal links pointing to and away from a new or updated piece of content. We added it as the last step before submitting to search engines for indexing and our website has grown 20% per month ever since. If you believe that internal linking is part of a solid SEO approach, then do yourself a favor and get Link Whisper.\n    \n*   ![Image 45]()\n    \n    > Link Whisper has become an integral part of my article publishing process. While Link Whisper makes it fast and simple to add internal links to any post, its real strength, in my opinion, comes from the internal link reports. Not only can I see which posts don‚Äôt have any internal links pointing to them, but I can quickly create links from any post to that specific article. This lets me add links from dozens of posts on a single screen rather than manually opening and editing posts one at a time. This feature alone has saved me hours and hours of time.\n    \n*   ![Image 46]()\n    \n    > As someone with a blog in a very saturated niche, it‚Äôs important for the technicalities, link internal links, on my website to be on point. Link Whisper does two AMAZING things for ‚Äì #1 It makes inserting internal links into new posts without a second thought. #2 The reports allow me to audit posts and use some of my internal link juice for SEO techniques. Link Whisper makes this process easy, simple, and super quick. It‚Äôs a must-have for every single blogger.",

    "homepage": "Title: Free Paraphrasing For All Languages\n\nURL Source: \n\nMarkdown Content:\n###### Getting your wording just right\n\nParaphrasing is a natural part of the writing process as it helps you clarify your thinking and suit your words to your audience. Using a Paraphrase Tool helps structure and streamline this work, and our paraphrase tool offers 20 modes, many of them free, for accomplishing just this. The 20 modes we offer are diverse, including a summarize tool, a free grammar checker, a mode to simplify text, and a sentence shortener. There are sentence rephrasers and paraphrase rephrase tools, and we pride ourselves on having both, since our reword generator accounts for context at both the sentence and paragraph levels.\n\nWhen you google paraphrase you will get a variety of results, from a free Paraphrase Tool, to an article spinner, to a general phrase tool, and it can be hard to determine which of these rephrase tools will best help you complete your work. If you simply need to get a word rephrase, that is, reword only small elements within the sentence, many tools will suffice, but there is the risk that you end up with a tool that does not consider context and produces very awkward and ungrammatical sentences. Rephrasing is very much an art, and we‚Äôve built our paraphrase bot to produce the most correct results in 20 modes in over 100 languages, making it the best paraphrasing tool at an exceptionally low cost. So whether you need to paraphrase deutsch, paraphrase greek, or paraphrase bahasa melayu, the next time you think, I need something to paraphrase this for me, you‚Äôll know where to turn.\n\n###### From keywords to paragraphs\n\nGenerating paragraphs with unique ideas can be challenging, and too often writers get stuck at this stage of the writing process. With our paragraph tool, you can enter keywords and let our AI generate paragraphs for you, so that you can have something to work with, refine the output, and become more engaged in your writing.\n\nA paragraph generator creates links between your ideas, such that the output is sensible, unique, and stimulating, very close to what you would expect a thoughtful human paragraph writer to produce.\n\nParagraph makers are nice, but what about a short story generator? Because our AI is generalized, it serves a story generator, an essay generator, a poem generator, and much more. To generate compelling stories, you should provide the story generator with useful keywords from which it can develop plot elements, including characters, setting details, and any situational information. To generate reasonably good essays, you should likewise provide the essay maker with details around argumentative positions and any other pertinent ideas. If you more specifically want an introduction paragraph generator or conclusion paragraph generator, you can provide starter text and keywords that will best enable our essay creator to produce them.\n\nYou may well ask, ‚Äúis this essay generator free?‚Äù Everything on this site is free within a 3-day trial, so you can test and develop confidence in our products. You may also be wondering where this is an essay automatic writer or if it will take a while to get results. All results appear within a matter of seconds, so you can move through your work as quickly as possible.\n\nYou may have professional needs for creating paragraphs as well, such as those needed for cover letter. Most of the time a cover letter template includes information that is not relevant to you; by using your own keywords, we can produce cover letter examples that are relevant to your use case and often require very little editing. By using this service, you can also learn how to write a cover letter and achieve the cover letter format you need.\n\n###### Plagiarism checker free\n\nLike everything else on our site, you can check plagiarism free within a trial, which is a great opportunity for those who want to check a paper for plagiarism without committing to paying before they see results. This free plagiarism checker is great for students and clearly indicates how to check for plagiarism by highlighting areas of similarity between the two texts. Just to be sure you are not accidentally plagiarizing, be sure to check all of your paraphrases as well.",

Believe me or not, you will see a marginal increase in your CTRs and Conversions if you follow and work on the suggested creatives. Perfect for Freelancers (like me), Digital Marketing Agencies, and even Small and Medium sized enterprises.\n\nGeorge G.\n\n@georgeg\n\n![Image 150]()\n\nThe quality of the AI blew me away\n\nI have been doing creative design for the past 8 years and I can tell you that this app is different. The quality of the AI blew me away, as I never use these features because from my experience they are always just BAD. The technology doesnt work yet and the results are... not good :) In case of adcreative the AI tool is saving me so much time and I use these designs to deliver advertisements for my clients who are promoting 6 and 7 figure businesses. That means these designs work and can run a business, can't tell that about any other app.\n\n[Try For Free Now]()\n\n![Image 151]()\n\nAdCreative.ai Enterprise\n------------------------\n\nAdCreative.ai Enterprise Program, a bespoke solution tailored for businesses seeking to boost  \ntheir creative potential while prioritizing scalability, collaboration, and privacy.\n\n![Image 152]()\n\n### A scalable,  \nreliable platform\n\nScale your creative output, content quality, and campaign performance to match your business needs ‚Äî without worrying about reliability.\n\n![Image 153]()\n\n### Advanced collaboration\n\nQuickly and securely generate and launch high-impact creative assets with AdCreative.ai‚Äôs powerful features, designed to facilitate collaboration among large teams.\n\n![Image 154]()\n\n### Dedicated, account manager\n\nFrom seamless implementation to real-time troubleshooting, AdCreative.ai offers personalized assistance, backed by a dedicated account manager for every Enterprise Customer.\n\n![Image 155]()\n\n### Security  \nand compliance\n\nLaunch with confidence: our platform ensures that your data remains protected, is never shared with third parties, and is secure within your own dedicated instance.\n\nLooking for an Enterprise plan starting at $12,000/year?¬† [Get in touch]() ¬†with our Enterprise Sales Team today.\n\n![Image 156: Team Image]()\n\nREADY TO START?\n\nBring your ad creative game  \nto the next level with AdCreative.ai!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Generate Ad Creatives]( 100% free for 7 days. **Cancel Anytime**\n\n![Image 157: Product of the day 2nd]()\n\n![Image 158]()\n\n[Read more adcreative-ai reviews]()\n\n![Image 159: AdCreative AI Logo]( with ‚ô• in Paris!\n\n2022 AdCreative.ai | All rights reserved.\n\n**Need help?** Reach us at: \n\n**PAGES**\n\n[Home Page]( Is For?]( Creatives]( Texts & Headlines]( Insights]()\n\n**ADCREATIVE.AI**\n\n[Terms and Conditions]( Policy]()\n\n[For support and refund-related inquiries, please write to us at \n\n![Image 160]()\n\nOfficial Channels\n\n[![Image 161: Linkedin Logo]( 162: Twitter Logo]( 163: YouTube Logo]( 164: Insta Logo]( 165: Pinterest Logo](/)\n\nAdCreative.ai is the main sponsor of Ad World Conference, the world‚Äôs largest advertising event",

However, if you want to use Canva for work or a side hustle, you can upgrade to Canva Pro to unlock premium features, such as unlimited templates and Brand Kits.\n    \n    And if you need to collaborate with colleagues? You might be interested in a Canva Teams subscription, which is ideal for small to medium-sized businesses. With Canva Teams, you'll enjoy all the premium features of a Canva Pro plan, with more ways to collaborate and communicate as a team ‚Äì including efficient approval processes, real-time communication, and centralized asset management.\n    \n    Want to see for yourself? You can start a free Canva Pro or Canva Teams trial for 30 days.\n    \n*   Canva Pro is the best subscription for individual entrepreneurs and professionals looking to create visually stand-out content with ease. Only one person can use a Canva Pro account.\n    \n    If you want to collaborate with one or more colleagues, then you'll need to sign up for Canva Teams. This subscription is ideal for small to medium-sized businesses ready to boost team productivity with real-time communication and simplified workflows.\n    \n*   Both Canva Pro and Canva Teams subscriptions unlock Canva's premium features and tools.\n    \n    The difference comes down to who‚Äôs using it. Canva Pro is the perfect plan for individuals who want save time and design with full creative confidence. You can collaborate on projects and share your work with others, but if you're working on a small team, we'd recommend Canva Teams.\n    \n    Canva Teams is designed to meet the needs of teams in small or medium-sized companies. You get access to a joint workspace where team members can work together, share designs, and give feedback in real time. It‚Äôs the ultimate teamwork tool.\n    \n*   Depending on which subscription works best for you or your business, you can start a free {0}-day trial of Canva Pro or Canva Teams.

You can cancel any time during your trial and won't be charged.\n    \n*   If you're using Canva Teams, you can invite other team members to join your team. You won't be billed at all during your trial period.\n    \n    However, if you're using Canva Pro, you won't be able to add new team members as this plan is designed for individuals. To add new team members, you'll need to upgrade to a Canva Teams plan.\n    \n*   Canva Teams is best suited for individual teams in small to mid-size businesses that don‚Äôt require complex team management and controls. Canva Enterprise is a great fit for multiple and large single teams of more than 100 people, mainly in mid-to-large organizations and with complex requirements around security, administration, and team management.\n    \n    While both plans unlock premium content and features, Canva Enterprise can level up your company's visual communication and asset management with advanced brand controls, custom integrations, advanced security features, and admin controls.

We also support other online payment systems in some countries. Take a look at this help article to learn more about [payment options]().\n    \n*   Canva Teams operates on a pay-as-you grow model. This means you only pay for the team members who accept your invitation. There's no immediate charge; billing is adjusted monthly, or quarterly if you're on an annual subscription. If you're on a monthly billing cycle, you can add new people at any time. You'll only be charged for the active people you have on your team at the next monthly renewal.\n    \n    For those on annual billing cycles, we have four pay-as-you grow check-ins throughout the year. We'll email the team admin to inform them of any upcoming charges and give them a period to update their team size.\n    \n    Any additional costs will then be charged proportionally to the time remaining for your annual renewal. For example, if you add an additional seat at the first quarterly check-in, you'll be charged 75% of that seat's annual cost.\n    \n    Canva Enterprise offers great flexibility for your billing needs, including the option to set up regular invoicing. To learn more about your billing options with Canva Enterprise, [reach out]() to our sales team.\n    \n*   Your designs are always private, unless you explicitly choose to share them or save them as templates for your team.\n    \n*   For enquires about choosing the right plan or creating a personalized package for your organization, please reach out to our Sales team via the [Contact Sales form]().",

Upload a setOf just 20 to 30 photos in a diverse range of places, settings, and times. By inputting these images into your AI model, you're teaching it to recognize and replicate it.  \n  \nYou only need to train your AI model once which takes about 30 minutes. Then you can take infinite photos with it.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nTry on clothes 2.0\n------------------\n\nTake any outfit you like (like from Shein or Zara), take a screenshot and paste it into Photo AI and it will dress up your AI model with it. The new version 2 of our try on model is better than ever and now even works with patterns and prints.\n\n  \nDo entire photo shoots from your computer without having to fly around models and entire crews of photographers, light people, directors and producers half way around the world for a shoot. Just prompt the shoot design yourself, select your AI model and upload a piece of clothing!\n\n  \nPerfect for Shopify store owners who want unique photos of models trying out their products.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nDesign photorealistic scenes\n----------------------------\n\nDesign any scene you wish, from commonplace to rare, stunning instances. Imagine the ability to create a photograph of a sunlit Parisian cafe in the 1920s, or a moonlit beach in Bali with just the right clothes, all from the comfortOf your living room.  \n  \nSimply describe your desired scene and watch as the model generates a highly realistic photo that aligns with your vision. Taking photos is fast: right now it takes about 127 seconds per photo.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nCreate video clips with AI\n--------------------------\n\nTake any AI photo you generated, and turn it into a video by tapping \\[ Make video \\]. A few minutes later you have a short video clip of the photo giving you an immersive virtual reality like experience.  \n  \nNext features we'll add is boomerang videos, background audio and music, longer 10-30 second clips and voice scripts where the AI model lip syncs.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nSketch2Image‚Ñ¢\n-------------\n\nWith Photo AI's Sketch2Image‚Ñ¢ you can now create photorealistic renders from your raw fashion design sketches. Imagine doing a quick draftOf an idea you have. Upload it to Photo AI and 40 seconds later you have a realistic AI photo of how it'd look in real life. A photorealistic render you can use to show potential vendors, customers, and suppliers.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nFrequently asked questions\n--------------------------\n\n[![Image 40](:)\n\n#### Do you have an affiliate program?\n\nYes we do! When you [join Photo AI's affiliate program]() you receive a 30% commission on payments for all customers you refer!\n\n#### How does Photo AI's AI Photo Generator work?\n\nPhoto AI lets you upload selfies, create AI characters and then generate AI photos with them. We teach the AI how you look and then it's able to generate photorealistic images of you. You can put yourself in different settings, with different outfits, doing different actions, with different expressions. And best of all, you can do all this from your laptop or phone without having to pay an expensive photographer $100s or $1000s.  \n  \nAfter sign up you get access to Photo AI's studio which lets you use our photo shoot preset templates, write prompts or copycat photos of other people, to generate anything you can think of.\n\n#### What AI model do you use?\n\nPhoto AI uses our own AI generation pipeline which is trained for high photorealism. We keep working on improving it, with better photorealistic data sets, using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) by users like you which constantly improves our models. All of this to get you better more photorealistic images.\n\n#### Do you have an iOS app?\n\nYes! Photo AI is [available on iOS now](). The web version is more advanced than the iOS app for now though.\n\n#### Can I create AI influencers with Photo AI?\n\nYes! The easiest way is to first describe how you want your AI influencer to look in the prompt box (like \"pink hair 25 y o woman IG influencer\" and selecting a plain AI model (like White Woman), then generating several photos. Save the ones you like most. Then on the left sidebar, scroll down to \\[ Create new AI character \\], upload your generated photos. It will now generate a new AI character based on your generated photos and will make sure they remain consistent across generations.\n\n#### How much does Photo AI cost?\n\nYou can check current pricing by entering your email in the sign up box and following the link to see the pricing table. You get 6+ months free if you pay yearly. You can cancel at any time.\n\n#### My payment card is not accepted when signing up?\n\nDue to lots of fraud attempts, we've had to increase our payment security. Firstly, disable your VPN or proxy server. Then make sure your name, CVC and postal code match the one on your payment card and of your bank account. Also your card country should be the same as your billing country. And finally make sure you enable 3D Secure or similar authentication on your card with your bank.\n\n#### What type of photos should I upload for creating an AI character?\n\nWe recommend uploading photos with high variety, a mix of close-up selfies and full body shots in a variety of places, angles, clothes and expressions. Do not upload photos with low variety, group photos, other people, sunglasses, hats, photos where your face is cut off or not visible.\n\n#### What file formats of photos do you accept for creating an AI character?\n\nWe accept JPG, PNG, WebP and AVIF files only. HEIC is not supported now, so you'll have to convert those to JPG first\n\n#### How long will it take to create my AI character?\n\nBased on the current processing times, it takes about 30 minutes to create an AI character.\n\n#### How long will it take to take an AI photo?\n\nBased on the current processing times, it takes about 127 seconds to take one photo.

Your data privacy and security are our top priorities.\n\n#### Who built and is behind Photo AI?\n\nThis service was built by me, [Pieter Levels (@levelsio)](), a Dutch indie entrepreneur known for other projects like [Nomad List](/), [Remote OK](/), and [Interior AI](/).\n\n#### Can I use Photo AI to try on clothes?\n\nYes! You can upload any clothes and the character will wear them for you. The character isn't great with prints yet, but we're working on making it perfect for that too very soon.\n\n#### How much will the photos look like me?\n\nThe resemblance of the photos to you depends on the quality and variety of the photos you upload. The better and more varied your photos, the more accurately the AI can understand and represent your unique characteristics. We keep improving our models every day.\n\n#### Will the photos have AI artefacts?\n\nSometimes yes. Depending on the quality of the uploaded photos, and the type of photos you take, you might see some AI artefacts. Any app that uses generative AI imaging will have artefacts. They can be illogical things like extra arms, deformed faces etc. From our experience, about 75% of photos you take will be good enough, and 10% will be exceptionally good. W also have an editor so you can brush away artefacts yourself and regenerate those parts. We're improving Photo AI every day to reduce artefacts for example by auto-detecting them and then re-trying. But remember it's not perfect yet and we're not promising it is!\n\n#### Can I upload or generate photos of kids or minors?\n\nNo, it is strictly prohibited to upload or generate photos of kids or minors. Our service is designed for legal adults (18+) only. Additionally, AI results can be unpredictable with children, so it's best to refrain from doing so.\n\n#### How do I get 6+ months free when signing up?\n\nIf you sign up for the yearly plan, the pricing is over 50% cheaper, which means 6+ months free compared to regular monthly pricing. Make sure to select yearly and you are saving a lot of money! This is our way of thanking you for your trust in our Photo AI and lets us reinvest your money to improve the product.\n\n#### Do I get access after paying?\n\nYes, immediately after payment you get an automated email with a login link. You can then create your first AI model and start taking AI photos. Creating a model usually takes ~30 minutes and then taking a photo takes ~30 seconds.\n\n#### Is the payment service secure?\n\nYes, our payment service is secure. We use Stripe for financial processing, and we do not store any information about your card. Stripe ensures bank-level security standards.\n\n#### Can I get a receipt or invoice?\n\nYes, after payment you get a receipt and invoice.\n\n#### Is my data secure? Do my photos and models remain private?\n\nYes! The models you create and photos you upload and take stay private. Your personal data, images, and AI models are stored securely, and our system is designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.\n\n#### What methods of payment do you accept?\n\nWe accept payments via credit or debit cards, including MasterCard, VISA, American Express, as well as iDeal, SOFORT, Bancontact, Przelewy24, Giropay, EPS, GrabPay, AliPay, and many more.

In turn, our upstream providers do not let us ask for refunds for the GPU processing time used to create your AI characters and generate your AI photos. This would make it a loss making endeavor for us. During sign up you agree to withhold your right to refund for this reason.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to us.\n\nWhat do you do with my photos after training?\n\nWe train our AI model with input photos, render avatars then delete them and the models from our servers/GPU API's within 7 days. To delete faster simply press Delete and we'll erase all data instantly. Beware of other apps - they store data forever & can generate images with your face. Some are even linked to foreign governments.\n\nWhy are your prices so high?\n\nAI training is expensive, as it takes a lot of resources to train on a single subject. We offset these charges in our pricing. If you see any company charging less or free, understand these services earn money by selling your data. We do not.\n\nWhat type of photos should I upload?\n\nWe recommend 10 close-ups, 3 side profiles, 5 chest-up and 3 full body shots. Variety is key: facial expressions, locations, backgrounds and perspectives should all be different. Look away from the camera too. High quality photos work best; minimal makeup is advised as it may be exaggerated in the photos. No nudes, swimwear/underwear is OK.\n\nWho build this app?\n\nMe, Danny Postma, a solopreneur from The Netherlands. I previously started Headlime.com, which got acquired by the largest AI copywriting tool in the world, Jasper.AI. I do not have any investor and built this project 100% by myself. This means that I do not have any ulterior motives with your data, as no one tells me what to do.\n\nWhere is my data stored?\n\nData is stored securely on servers in the United States, by vetted, highly secure, third party partners of us.\n\nCan I get a refund?\n\nYes, we can refund purchases made within the first 14 days, provided you haven‚Äôt trained the AI yet. After 14 days or once a plan is used, it is no longer eligible for a refund. Please refer to our Terms of Service for details.\n\nWhat photo formats do you accept?\n\nWe support JPG, PNG, WebP, and HEIC but not AVIF or GIF.\n\nIs payment secure?\n\nYes, we use Stripe for payment. We do not store any of your credit card information.\n\nCan I get an invoice?\n\nYes, you can get an invoice for your purchase. Head to the invoice page after purchase, add your details and save to PDF.\n\nCan I use my photos anywhere?\n\nYes, you can use your photos anywhere you want. You can use them on your social media profiles, on your website, on your business cards, etc. You can also use them for your personal use, such as on your dating profile, etc.\n\nTry it out now\n\nCreate your perfect profile picture with AI.\n--------------------------------------------\n\n* * *\n\n¬© Copyright 2023, All Rights Reserved by Postcraft PTE LTD",

Cold emails are typically sent to people who the sender has no prior relationship with, and are often used as a marketing or sales strategy to reach new potential customers or clients.\n\nCold emails can be an effective way to reach out to people and introduce yourself or your business, but it's important to be careful and respectful when sending cold emails. It's a good idea to clearly state the purpose of the email in the subject line and the first few sentences of the email, and to keep the email brief and to the point. It's also important to respect the recipient's time and attention, and to not send unsolicited emails too frequently.\n\nCold email can be an effective way to reach out to potential customers or clients, but it's important to approach it with care and respect for the recipient's time and attention. If done well, cold email can help you establish new relationships and potentially generate leads for your business.\n\nHowever, it's important to keep in mind that cold email can also be seen as spam if it's not done well, and it can be easy for recipients to ignore or delete cold emails without reading them. To increase the chances that your cold emails will be successful, it's important to follow best practices, such as:\n\n*   Personalizing the email and addressing the recipient by name\n*   Keeping the email brief and to the point\n*   Clearly stating the purpose of the email in the subject line and the first few sentences\n*   Being respectful of the recipient's time and attention\n*   Providing value to the recipient in some way (e.g., offering helpful information or resources)\n*   Being mindful of local laws and regulations regarding unsolicited emails\n\nOverall, it's important to approach cold email with a strategic and targeted approach, and to be respectful of the recipient's time and attention. If done well, cold email can be an effective way to reach out to potential customers or clients.\n\nCold email software is designed to help businesses and individuals send targeted and personalized emails to potential customers or clients. Cold email software typically includes a range of features that can help users create and send effective cold emails, such as:\n\n*   Email templates: Many cold email software programs offer pre-designed email templates that can be customized with the user's own content and branding.\n    \n*   Personalization: Cold email software often includes tools for personalizing emails with the recipient's name, location, or other information. This can help make the emails more targeted and effective.\n    \n*   Automation: Some cold email software includes tools for automating the sending of emails, such as scheduling emails to be sent at a specific time or setting up drip campaigns (i.e., a series of automated emails that are sent out over a period of time).\n    \n*   Analytics and tracking: Cold email software may include tools for tracking the performance of emails, such as how many were opened, how many clicks were generated, and how many leads were generated. This can help users understand what is working and what is not, and make adjustments accordingly.\n    \n*   Integration with other tools: Many cold email software programs can be integrated with other tools, such as customer relationship management (CRM) software or marketing automation platforms. This can help users manage their cold email campaigns more effectively and efficiently.\n    \n\nOverall, the specific features offered by cold email software will depend on the specific product or service, and it's important to carefully consider which features are most important for your needs before making a decision.\n\nAn email warming service is a tool that helps businesses improve the deliverability of their email campaigns by gradually increasing the volume of emails sent to a specific domain or mailbox provider over a period of time. This process, known as \"warming up\" an email list, helps to establish the sender's reputation and reduce the likelihood of emails being flagged as spam or rejected by the recipient's email server.\n\nHere is a general overview of how an email warming service works:\n\nGet a MailRush.io account with Free email warming: To use an email warming service, you will need to sign up for an account and provide the service with information about your business and email campaigns. This may include the types of emails you plan to send, the number of recipients on your email list, and the frequency of your campaigns.\n\nWarm up your email list: The email warming service will then begin the process of warming up your email list by gradually increasing the volume of emails sent to a specific domain or mailbox provider over a period of time. This may involve sending a small number of emails initially and gradually increasing the volume over the course of several weeks or months.\n\nMonitor and track your results: As the email warming service warms up your email list, it will monitor and track the deliverability of your emails to identify any issues or problems. It may provide you with reports or analytics that show the performance of your campaigns and suggest ways to improve their deliverability.\n\nMaintain your reputation: After your email list has been warmed up, it is important to maintain your reputation by sending high-quality, relevant emails to your subscribers and complying with email marketing best practices.\n\nThere are two components in our email warming automation.\n\n*   **Ramping up the daily sending volume**: It will gradually increase the number of emails you can send in a day. Consequently, at the early stage of the account, the daily sending limit will be low, and it will increase as the account ages to reach the advertised daily limit for the plan of your choice.\n*   **Engagement Credits for Mail Warming**: The system automates sending emails to a seed list on multiple providers to create positive actions and improve engagement levels.\n\nMailRush.io will not perform well for the following activities.\n\n*   If you want to send a large number of emails at the early stage of the account without a warm up process.\n*   If you expect a high frequency of email going out without any restriction or abuse/reputation control.\n*   If you plan to send B2C email outreach campaigns.\n\nEmail deliverability refers to the ability of an email to reach the intended recipient's inbox. When an email is successfully delivered, it means that it has been accepted by the recipient's email server and is available for the recipient to read.\n\nThere are several factors that can impact email deliverability, including the sender's reputation, the content of the email, and the recipient's email server settings. Senders with a good reputation and high-quality, relevant emails are more likely to have their emails delivered, while senders with a poor reputation or spammy emails are more likely to have their emails flagged as spam or rejected.\n\nThere are also technical factors that can impact email deliverability, such as the recipient's email server settings and the configuration of the sender's email server. Ensuring that these technical factors are properly set up can help improve the deliverability of your emails.\n\nOverall, email deliverability is an important factor for businesses and organizations that rely on email communication, as low deliverability rates can result in missed opportunities and lost revenue.\n\nEmail Deliverability is complex, and it depends on multiple factors, including but not limited to:\n\n*   **Email Account Warm up**: All accounts need to get warmed up to build a reputation and perform better for inbox placement.\n*   **Domain name age**: New domains are required to build a sending reputation.\n*   **Sending IP Address**: The IP address needs to be warmed up to build a sending reputation. We suggest a dedicated IP for having more control over the sending reputation of the IP address assigned to your account.\n*   **List hygiene**: High bouncing rate will result in a poor sending score.\n*   **Contact list**: Your contact list needs to be well researched and relevant to your email copywriting.\n*   **Email Cadence**: Space out your emails to avoid overwhelming a provider with connections.\n*   **Content Rotation**: Do not send the same content over and over. Use Email Personalization in addition to rotating the content.\n*   **Seed List**: Use an email seed list to generate engagement and positive activities.\n*   **Follow Anti-Spam regulations**: Providers will check if you comply with international anti-spam regulations. Personalize your email content, give the user an option to unsubscribe, and add your email signature with your address.\n*   **Email Copywriting**: Be conversational when creating your email templates; avoid click-baits and large email content.\n*   **Email Volume**: Send a suitable number of emails and scale up the volume over time. Do not overwhelm providers with connections. Keep your email volume low at the early stage of the account.\n*   **Track Mail Deliverability Reports**: Track and comply with the warnings received from email providers.\n*   **Sending Hours**: Set a time frame when you want to send emails. Do not send emails 24x7.\n*   **Track Deliverability KPIs**: Monitor your MailRush KPIs (Feedback Loop and Reputation Center) to adjust your campaign. Monitoring will help you to overcome blocks imposed by providers and improve inbox placement.\n*   **Track Inbox Placement in all providers**: Track how your emails reach multiple providers, trial and error possible deliverability problems.\n*   **Click to Action**: Make use of a clear and unique click-to-action to increase the conversion rate. Don't saturate your cold email template with multiple links.\n\nWhen using MailRush, if you run a healthy cold email outreach campaign, your performance indicators will be good. We offer automation for many of the best practices, but inbox placement takes time and effort.\n\nThe difference relies on having control over the sender's reputation.\n\n*   **Shared IP**: When using an SMTP with shared IP, your campaign will inherit the reputation of all the domains using that IP.\n*   **Dedicated IP**: When using an SMTP with a dedicated IP, you are the only user using the IP. A Dedicated IP allows you to build a sender reputation that should perform well in long-term cold email campaigns.\n\nShared IP and dedicated IP refer to the types of IP addresses that can be used to send cold emails. A shared IP is an IP address that is used by multiple senders to send emails, while a dedicated IP is an IP address that is used by a single sender or organization.\n\nThere are a few key differences between shared IP and dedicated IP that can impact the success of a cold email campaign:\n\n*   Deliverability: One of the main differences between shared IP and dedicated IP is the impact on email deliverability. Emails sent from a shared IP may be more likely to be flagged as spam or rejected by the recipient's email server due to the potential for abuse by other users sharing the same IP. On the other hand, emails sent from a dedicated IP are more likely to be delivered, as the IP is associated with a single sender or organization.\n*   Reputation: Another important factor is the impact on sender reputation. When multiple senders use a shared IP, the IP's reputation can be affected by the actions of all the users. This can lead to deliverability issues if one or more of the users engage in spammy or abusive behavior. With a dedicated IP, the sender's reputation is tied to the actions of a single organization, which can make it easier to maintain a good reputation.\n*   Control: Using a dedicated IP allows you to have more control over your email campaigns and the reputation of your domain. With a shared IP, you may have less control over the actions of other users and may be more at risk of having your emails flagged as spam or rejected.\n\nStart exploring MailRush.io with a Free Trial\n---------------------------------------------\n\nExperience the seamless optimization of your cold email outreach workflow with MailRush.io.

Definition\n    -----------------------------\n    \n    A chatbot is a **discussion robot** programmed to converse with a human in an automated way via a chat.\n    \n    Chatbots are very present on the internet, and it is almost certain that you have already come across one without knowing ! It is a **software programmed to maintain a conversation with a human**. This discussion can be written or oral, giving the user the impression of exchanging with another individual.\n    \n    If you've ever seen a small chat appear when you open a website, with a question \"how can I help you?\" then you have met a **chatbot**!\n    \n    When used more extensively, the **chatbot** combines artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP or TLN). It is then more efficient, but also more greedy in server resources.\n    \n    Here again, you have already come across them: Siri from the Apple brand and Alexa from the Amazon group are none other than voice chatbots! ChatGPT or Google Bard, text chatbots! Botnation chatbots, marketing discussion robots at the service of your business needs!\n    \n    For the record, the first chatbot that was born was the robot **ELIZA**, created by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966.\n    \n*   How do chatbots work?\n    ---------------------\n    \n    The simplest chatbots, like those used for FAQs, run on TLN or NLP processing, with very little machine learning (ML). The answers given are generated automatically and conventionally, and are mainly used to help and guide the user in order to respond quickly to his requests. These chatbots can for example be programmed to detect **trigger words** present in user inputs: order tracking, delivery, etc.\n    \n    Predictive chatbots, which are better known as virtual or digital assistants, work by understanding TLN or NLP and ML. These software perform an analysis in order to personalize their outputs, which then correspond to the behavior and profiles of users. Over time, this virtual assistant can make recommendations and, for example, anticipate the future needs or requests of the individual.\n    \n*   What is the use of a chatbot?\n    -----------------------------\n    \n    The chatbot is useful for responding instantly and accurately to users' questions. When the user is on a merchant site and interacts with this bot, customer support is freed up, phone lines are less busy and responses are faster. A computer program that makes everyone a winner!\n    \n    For shy people who do not always dare to contact certain platforms by email or telephone, the chatbot is also particularly appreciated here rather than contacting the after-sales service.\n    \n    The information obtained by the chatbot can help customers place orders, which also serves the interests of the company.\n    \n*   What are the different types of chatbots?\n    -----------------------------------------\n    \n    There are actually two types of chatbots. The first are the so-called simple or basic bots, which we often come across on different websites. These usually work in the form of questions, such as **FAQ** where the answer we are looking for is displayed after checking several boxes.\n    \n    Intelligent, or evolved, bots are more complex and incorporate NLP or TLN. The question asked by the user can then be written or formulated orally, while he will receive an answer also written or pronounced orally, by the software. Many people use this type of chatbot on a daily basis.\n    \n*   What are the benefits of a chatbot for businesses?\n    --------------------------------------------------\n    \n    Using a chatbot helps to optimize operational efficiency, responding instantly to user requests and **avoiding overloading customer support**. The questions asked by individuals are recorded, companies can then anticipate these and provide new answers on their website, for example. Tutorials, a more advanced FAQ, or even a guided tour, can be added and make the customer's visit easier!\n    \n    But the conversational agent is not only useful for after-sales service: it can also allow you to make more sales by **resolving the obstacles to purchase** by answering your customers' questions. 24/7 users.\n    \n    A marketing chatbot can also allow you to **capture more leads**, being a real dynamic alternative to classic forms.\n    \n    The chatbot can also offer a similar product when an individual launches a search and the desired service is no longer available. For commercial companies, it is an excellent process to **optimize sales**, and this, in a few clicks!\n    \n    Botnation chatbots are versatile. No matter what industry your business is in, you can easily create and configure a bot that is useful for your business.\n    \n*   What are the benefits of a chatbot for users?\n    ---------------------------------------------\n    \n    Falling on a chatbot is always appreciable, when we are a little lost on an application, a website, when we are looking for a particular product, etc. Rather than leaving our screen to type our request elsewhere, this computer program immediately responds to our request and allows us to **save time**.\n    \n    Because it responds to us in a **dynamic** way, the chatbot also gives us the impression of exchanging with a human, which makes our internet browsing more pleasant. **The user experience is energized, improved**.\n    \n    The chatbot can be installed **where your customers usually go**:\n    \n    *   On your website\n    *   On Facebook\n    *   On WhatsApp\n    \n    So the user can choose where to have information about your business. There is a notion of proximity to your customer and their habits.\n    \n    The customer or prospect can get an answer to his questions instantly, without having to wait for the availability of a human. This can quickly remove barriers to purchase.\n    \n    According to a study carried out by Botnation, 59% of consumers appreciate being able to ask their questions to a chatbot. 89% like to have a quick answer to their questions.\n    \n    The chatbot is therefore able to improve the customer experience. Having a successful customer relationship with your brand will move the person up the customer satisfaction ladder, which can **improve conversion rate** and **purchase repeat**.\n    \n*   How to create a chatbot?\n    ------------------------\n    \n    To create a conversational agent, there are 2 main solutions:\n    \n    **1\\. Use the skills of an expert agency in the field**\n    \n    You can use specialized **chatbot creation agencies**, such as **Botnation**.\n    \n    Be aware that several possibilities are available to you regarding the choice of your Botnation plan.\n    \n    There is a **free plan** that allows you to configure and test your chatbot. You can indeed **easily configure your Botnation conversational agent yourself** according to your needs, and this, **without having to code**!\n    \n    You can also entrust this realization to a our IT specialists if needed. Whatever your need for chatbot configuration or development, contact us!\n    \n    **2\\. Develop your own chatbot**\n    \n    You can also decide to program a chatbot yourself, without the help of an expert agency. You will surely be able, with experienced developers, to create a simple chatbot in **Python** or **PHP** for example. Be aware, however, that creating a successful chatbot is not an easy thing. Developing your own chatbot can therefore **cost you a lot** in time and/or money.\n    \n    At Botnation, we have been developing chatbots for years. Our teams of developers are experts in this specialized field. We can adapt our chatbots to your needs. We can also program a chatbot for you with tailor-made features.

You may also purchase 5 credits for $15 ($3 per credit).\n\nWhy can't I just use ChatGPT?\n\nYou wouldn‚Äôt use a toothbrush to paint a wall; you‚Äôd use a paintbrush. We wouldn‚Äôt recommend using ChatGPT if you‚Äôre searching for a streamlined way to lock in your dream career‚Ä¶ we‚Äôd recommend CoverDoc. Ironically, one of the many things that makes our tool original is its Originality Score, which scores your doc‚Äôs originality‚Äîwe like to remain unbiased. CoverDoc‚Äôs capabilities are broad, but its purpose is narrow: helping you obtain the perfect job match. The AI prompts used in CoverDoc are optimized for generating personalized cover letters based on your work experience. Finally, CoverDoc generates a Google Doc version of your cover letters and compensation evaluations for easy editing and distribution. Without CoverDoc a job seeker would need to write 14 different prompts for each job to get the same prep material that they can get in minutes with CoverDoc.\n\nIs it ethical to use AI for writing cover letters?\n\nIt‚Äôs only unethical if it lacks authenticity. The only thing CoverDoc lacks is the demand for your time. Our job-winning tools leverage you, your unique skills & experiences, and individual company insights to generate authentic applications that wow employers.\n\nDo I need to revise the generated cover letter before applying for jobs?\n\nYes! We highly recommend editing your cover letter to match your preferred writing style. AI is excellent for drafts but does require some human oversight to improve quality and relevancy.\n\nDoes this work for jobs outside the U.S.?\n\nYes! CoverDoc works for jobs, internships and dual education programs in any country. Paid plans include the option to set a preferred language for cover letters and negotiation advice. We currently support the following languages: Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Dutch, Japanese, Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian and Italian.\n\nWe would love to hear from you! The best way to give feedback is to use the \"Send Feedback\" link in the email and Google Doc. You can rate each cover letter by personalization, relevancy, and accuracy and each compensation evaluation by value.\n\nDo you offer an Affiliate Program?\n\nYes! Earn a 25% commission on the first 3 payments for paying customers you refer to CoverDoc. To enroll, scroll to the bottom of the page and select the \"Become an Affiliate\" link next to the Privacy Policy.

You can also test your agent without calling it via a chat screen in your dashboard.\n\n![Image 7]()\n\n### Affordable\n\nPlans start at just $49/mo for 100 calls, which is sufficient to support a wide array of businesses and use cases, and there is no commitment, so you can cancel any time.\n\n![Image 8]()\n\n### Customization\n\nYour AI agent can be highly customized to your use case. Whether it be for booking appointments, calculating mortgage payments, or answering FAQs, your customers will be impressed.\n\n![Image 9]()\n\n### Routing\n\nCalls can be routed or escalated to different numbers, and texts, emails, or webhooks can be sent to your team members, alerting them to specific customer needs.\n\n![Image 10]()\n\n### Voices\n\nChoose your preferred voice from a wide variety of languages and accents.

Once generated, the agent will be able to answer questions, book meetings, and leave messages, by answering the phone at the number we assign. From there, you'll be able to request customizations to the training data, wording, accents, behavior, phone number, and integrations as needed.\n\n[How much does Simple Phones cost? ![Image 16]( Phones starts at $49/mo for 100 calls/mo.

Of course, there is no commitment, so you can cancel at any time.\n\n[How is the AI agent created? ![Image 17]( base agent we generate can answer questions, book appointments, and leave messages. Once you have the agent, you can request customizations for free on an ongoing basis. You can request changes to the language, the phone country code, FAQs, or talk with our team about advanced integrations with your business. We also keep an eye on things, observing interaction logs (which you can see too), and update the agent with new info and fixes and better handling of customer inquiries.\n\n[Can I continue to use my existing business phone number? ![Image 18](, you can continue to use your existing business phone number. The only thing that changes is how you'd like to handle missed calls. For example, your current phone provider should have a way to forward missed calls to another number (the number we give you). Alternatively, you can set up your existing number to forward all calls to the number we give you, without any rings, and then have the AI agent decide what to do with the call, such as pre-screening callers before deciding to pass them to a live agent, or having them leave a message. Get in touch with us if you'd like to discuss a specific use case!\n\n[Does the AI integrate with my customer management system? ![Image 19](, whether you have a very popular CRM, or something that is completely homemade, our team can dive in and figure out how to make it work with your back end, so when your customers call, their requests can be fulfilled, and information can flow to the right place.

You can request all sorts of additions to your agent, such as a price calculator, custom knowledge base, or a searchable directory of currently available products or listings. For one hospital, we created a custom database of 5,000 doctors, so that when a patient calls and asks for their doctor by name, we can retrieve their information and book an appointment. In cases where a customer inquiry is unexpected or outside the scope of the AI's capability, we can have the call transferred to a member of your team, or have them leave a message.\n\n[What countries can I get an agent in? ![Image 21]( offer phone numbers in these countries: United States (+1), Canada (+1), Puerto Rico (+1), South Africa (+27), Belgium (+32), France (+33), Romania (+40), Switzerland (+41), United Kingdom (+44), Austria (+43), Germany (+49), Brazil (+55), Australia (+61), New Zealand (+64), Japan (+81), Portugal (+351), Ireland (+353), Finland (+358), Bulgaria (+359), Lithuania (+370), Estonia (+372), Croatia (+385), Slovenia (+386), Czechia (+420), and Israel (+972).

    "homepage": "Title: Create videos from text with neural frames\n\nURL Source: \n\nMarkdown Content:\n### Discover the synthesizer for the visual world.\n\n### Areas of use\n\nYou need visuals for every song you put out - the more the better. This is the best way to reach new audiences and stay on top of the mind of your listeners. With neural frames, you can bring your musical vision to life, in an audio-reactive way. neural frames feels like a digital audio workstation for video. A game changer for Spotify canvas, clips for social media and full-length video clips alike.\n\n![Image 1: Thumbnail]()\n\n### What you could create\n\nCreate animations as unique as your music.\n\nCreate fractal wonders in 4k.\n\nCreate visuals with a level of control that will blow your mind.\n\nCreate consistent characters thanks to our custom models.\n\nCreate novel audio-visual experiences.\n\nCreate the coolest abstract art.\n\nCreate to impress hundreds of thousands of people.\n\n### How it works\n\nOur AI animation generator takes words as inputs - so called prompts - which an AI will convert to motion content. The AI is based on Stable Diffusion, an artificial neural network that has seen 2.7 billion images. We have an AI-based prompt assistant to support with the tedious task of coming up with AI video prompts.\n\n### What others are saying\n\n![Image 2: Ben Nash]()\n\n###### Ben Nash\n\n[]()\n\n###### Designer, Developer & AI Artist\n\nThe first time I grasped the concept of neural frames, it felt akin to the wonder I experienced when I first delved into tools like Photoshop or After Effects. neural frames empowers artists, providing them with unparalleled abilities to craft astonishing videos that seamlessly blend visuals with various musical elements. It's a revolutionary tool for music video creators, standing in a league of its own with no comparable counterparts.\n\n![Image 3: Ina Veber]()\n\n###### Ina Veber\n\n[![Image 4: Ina Veber](/)\n\n###### Label manager 1605 records\n\nIt's super important to have visualizers for every release, but having them custom made is just sooo expensive. For something that's on Instagram for merely a story, we're unable to pay 100+ eur. We don't have a designated video person so getting visualizers done was always a bit of a nightmare. neural frames is a GREAT solution for it and I really love it.\n\n![Image 5: Aidan McCullen]()\n\n###### Aidan McCullen\n\n[]()\n\n###### Author & Host of The Innovation Show\n\nneural frames is the perfect AI-collaboration partner. It helps me create visuals for my articles and videos for my podcasts. Often, it brings me in new directions that I would never have thought of alone.\n\n![Image 6: Kirsty McGee]()\n\n###### Kirsty McGee\n\n[]()\n\n###### Singer & Songwriter\n\nI just created a video for a new song that comes out in a couple of months. It was like taking part in one of the most awe inspiring collaborative & after 20 years as a musician and songwriter, I believe the video might be one of the best things I've ever been involved in creating. As an artist in one field, trying to communicate in another artistic language can be almost impossible. Neural frames allowed me to surpass all of my expectations & create something visually surprising, moving, surreal and quite breathtaking. It was like working alongside an incredible artist whose fresh vision & lack of ego made the creative process like being in the presence of an enthralling and fascinating magic.\n\n![Image 7: SPACE LOGIC]()\n\n###### SPACE LOGIC\n\n[]()\n\n###### AI artist\n\nHarnessing the boundless potential of Neural Frames has been an odyssey through uncharted territories of digital artistry. As an AI video animation artist, I've voyaged across various platforms, but Neural Frames feels like stumbling upon an arcane tome of eldritch knowledge. It's not just a tool; it's a conduit, allowing the symphonies of my imagination to manifest into pulsating visual epics. When coupled with my profound reverence for sci-fi horror, Neural Frames transforms into a maestro's baton, orchestrating a dance between the uncanny and the ethereal. In the realm of AI-assisted creativity, many tools might offer you a paintbrush, but Neural Frames hands you the very stars to paint with.\n\n![Image 8: Schimaeras]()\n\n###### Schimaeras\n\n[]()\n\n###### Artist & Musician\n\nUsing neural frames has become a huge part of my life and work even in the few months I have known about it. It's given me a lot of creative drive and impetus to push the boundaries of creation as I explore this exciting new technology, which has impacted me profoundly as an artist, expanding my definition of what I thought possible in art. The neural discord server has also become an important part of my life - it's so amazing to be able to share this passion with other artists from all kinds of backgrounds, and see the unique ways in which everyone thinks, builds, and tells their stories.\n\n![Image 9: Thiago Monteiro]()\n\n###### Thiago Monteiro\n\n###### Builder\n\nI have been searching for an AI video creation tool for some time, and I'm delighted to have finally found a solution. neural frames has exceeded my expectations with its versatile features and has opened up new possibilities for me to create engaging short content for various projects.\n\n![Image 10: Brian Ortencio]()\n\n###### Brian Ortencio\n\n###### Web3 Coder & Beatmaker\n\nneural frames is a game changer! It took my NFT projects from stagnant boring stills to super dope animation visuals and with awesome consistency. No AI tool comes close in ease of use and being User friendly. All you need is some unique fresh prompts! NFT Visuals with beats and Neural Frames is for the streets! ‚úä\n\n![Image 11: Toby Hyder]()\n\n###### Toby Hyder\n\n###### Filmmaker & Digital Artist\n\nChaotically profound visual clay! It's hard not to fall in love with this artistic and addictive AI tool. I recommend anyone try it and start collaborating with this pioneering art machine!\n\n### Appeared on\n\n#### Our subscription options\n\nJoin hundreds of other creators.

We do not claim any rights to your videos. We will not use your videos unless you explicitly allow us to. If you create videos of objects that are protected by copyright, you are solely responsible for it. The same applies to uploaded audio files.\n\n##### What are standard models?\n\n###### neural frames allows you to choose between up to six standard models that all have their unique touches, just as every human intelligence has its own beauty. We have specialist models, which are particularly good in e.g. photorealistic or manga imagery and we have allrounder models that are all beautiful but have their own look. It's fun to play with different models and befriend them.\n\n##### What are custom models?\n\n###### Additionally to standard models, you can train your own AI models on any person, object or style. It works by uploading 10-20 images of object/person. This can be a super cool feature to achieve character consistency or to make ads. You can also use custom models to achieve certain styles. In this case, it is recommended to upload 50-100 images of that style.\n\n##### What is upscaling?\n\n###### Current video-generation AI models are trained on relatively low visual resolution, therefore an upscaling step is needed to get crisp videos of high resolution. Here, we have an extra AI that does nothing else but improving the videos and increasing their resolution. And it does so with absolute beauty. Unlike competitors, we don't charge extra for upscaling - in fact it is being done for every exported video by default and we are happy about every upscaled video we see.\n\n### News & Articles",
